This is a beta release of fvwm-themes.

FVWM Themes is an attempt to create easy, configurable and modular framework
for the FVWM configuration. You can visit the project's home page at:

	http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/

or project's developement page (where you download the package):

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/fvwm-themes/

This release should work out of box and is stable enough.
The developement continues.

How To Install
--------------

Please read INSTALL file.
In short you should execute after untarring fvwm-themes package:

	./configure
	make install

If you are upgrading from 0.2.* versions, please remove ~/.fvwm/themes-rc;
you can also remove all ~/.fvwm/*-old* directories and even directories
~/.fvwm/{themes,options,images,scripts,sounds}. They all are now in the site
place and not in the user place. User place is supported too, but you may
have some inconsistences if you leave old version files in your ~/.fvwm.

How to Start
------------

Make sure you use one of the latest developement versions of fvwm >= 2.3.22.
Replace the last line of your ~/.Xclients (or ~/.xinirc or ~/.xsession):
	fvwm2
with:
	fvwm-themes-start
and rerun X. See the fvwm-themes-start manual page for more details.
You should get the default theme, which you can change using the root menu.

How to use
----------

Once you start fvwm with the themes configuration, you get a very modular
fvwm setup, including menus, bindings, colors, background, modules and more.

There is a "Theme Management" menu. To change theme components, choose
a theme and click on "[ all ]" to load all components in the chosen theme
or on a specific component to load only it. Different components may have
different options, they can be changed in the "current" theme submenu.
For example, there are 42 color schemes in the cde theme, and 32 in the
luthien theme. You first choose cde->colors, then current->colors->scheme.
You can also fully manipulate theme components using the Themes Center GUI.

You will find more interesting things (about a possibility to ask a window
button itself what it does, about changing icon sets, or redefining bound
applications, or defining sessions and more) while exploring fvwm-themes.
Don't expect to learn fvwm-themes in one day. Just trying all the possible
combinations of different theme components and their options may take years.
There are more explanations in the FAQ.

Documentation
-------------

There is plenty of documentation in the doc/ directory.
Please read it before asking your questions. Thank you.

Notes
-----

* WARNING, this is developement version based on developement fvwm version.
  Since fvwm is changing right now, we only test fvwm-themes against the
  latest fvwm version as of fvwm-themes release date (2.3.29 for now).
  This will be changed after the stable fvwm-2.4 is out.
* For sound effects to work you need one of the sounds player listed under
  Theme Management->current->settings->Sound Player to be installed (but
  having one which can play .wav sound is a good idea). You can use esdplay
  with esd running or not. rplayd must be run for rplay. You should update
  your rplay.conf file with the sounds in sounds/ and themes/awol/sounds
  for rplayD.
* fvwm-themes is wm-icons compatible. If you want to use more icon sets
  than included 16x16-general and 48x48-general, you should install wm-icons
  package and choose "External wm-icons" in current/settings/Icon Styles.

Success to you and enjoy!
