This is a developement release of fvwm-themes.

FVWM Themes is an attempt to create easy, configurable and modular framework
for the FVWM configuration. You can visit the project's home page at:

	http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/

or project's developement page (where you download the package):

	https://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=1738

This release should work and is stable enough, but it does not contain yet
all planed functionality. Hopefully this is improved in the near future.

How To Install
--------------

Please read INSTALL file.
In short you should do after untarring fvwm-themes package:

	./configure
	make install

If you are upgrading from 0.2.* versions, please remove ~/.fvwm/themes-rc;
you can also remove all ~/.fvwm/*-old* directories and even directories
~/.fvwm/{themes,options,images,scripts,sounds}. They all are now in the site
place and not in the user place. User place is supported too, but you may
have some inconsistences if you leave old version files in your ~/.fvwm.

How to Start
------------

Make sure you use one of the latest developement versions of fvwm >= 2.3.22.
Replace the last line of your ~/.Xclients (or ~/.xinirc or ~/.xsession):
	fvwm2
with:
	fvwm-themes-start
and rerun X. See the fvwm-themes-start manual page for more details.
You should get the default theme, which you can change using the root menu.

Documentation
-------------

There is now an initial documentation in doc/ directory.
Please read it before asking your questions. Thank you.

Notes
-----

* WARNING, this is developement version based on developement fvwm version.
  Since fvwm is changing right now, we only test fvwm-themes against the
  latest fvwm version as of fvwm-themes release date (2.3.22 for now).
  This will be changed after the stable fvwm-2.4 is out.
* For sound effects to work you need either esdplay or rplay to be installed.
  rplayd must be run for rplay. You should update your rplay.conf file with
  the sounds in .fvwm/sounds for rplayD.
* fvwm-themes is wm-icons compatible. If you want to use more icon sets
  than included 16x16-general and 48x48-general, you should install
  wm-icons package and choose wm-icons choice of current/settings/Icon Styles.

Success to you and enjoy!
