	Some Maximizing works. Added some "simple" functions and use it.
	In the Maximize Menu use "On" in the place of the implicite toggle.
	Note: unfortunately, the Grow maximizing seems buggy in fvwm,
	"incremental" Grow does not work.

	* themes/*/buttons:
 	Use the FuncFvwmMaximize{,Vertically,Horizontally} functions,
	in the place of hard coded analogue, Shift All on maximize
	button give Grow (as lutien) and fix the ShowInfo for the max
	buttons

	Using of colors-extra@ is only temporary, I hope.
	Currently there is no titlebar button selector; to do?

	Image stick*.xpm was originally named hide*.xpm, but I don't know

	this is to enable user versions of sub-files in ~/.fvwm to be Read,
	probably it is not a good idea to enable user versions of sub-files

	* bin/fvwm-themes-start.in:
	actually prepend bindir to PATH even if it is here, but not first;
	the problem is that PATH is now not that user had initially,
	but running wrong versions of fvwm and fvwm-themes utilities
	(if there are several instalations) is probably worse for us

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config.in:
	* themes/*/*.cfg:
	Implemented !reuse-dependencies, !reset-properties (4 forms) cfg
	directives in components affecting definitions of components, which
	are specified more than once - either reset or reuse the existing
	definitions, this enables not to specify any dependancies in *.cfg,
	if they are not different from the default ones. Not fully tested.
	The current defaults are probably good, but this may be changed.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config.in:
	Small changes to the previous commit.
	I didn't really try a minimal reload yet.

	* TODO: added 2 items

	* themes/default/bindings:
	* themes/*/buttons:
	* themes/default/settings/stroke/*
	* themes/default/themes.cfg
	* themes/default/settings.cfg
	Starting minimal reload implementation. For simplification put
	the RemoveBindings, RemoveButtonsBindings and RemoveAllButtons
	functions into start-stop functions.
	Note: 1 - The minimal reload is really maximal: see the remarks
	in the fvwm-themes-config.in function "getReloadDependency".
	We must do something ...
	2 - The stop function is not well implemented and so drop do
	not use "minimal reload" ((un)lock work pretty well).
	3 - You can switch between global and "minimal" theme switching
	with the theme management menu (global is still the default):
	reload and refresh -> Use minimal/global switching. But first
	you need to make install, refresh the current theme and restart.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config.in:
	added a --rm-cfg-cache option. Now we can refresh the current theme
	and rebuild or not the config cache file in the theme management
	menu.

2001-01-03  migo  <migo@homemail.com>

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config.in:

	I will work on better names and removing repeating dependances later

	replaced some adobe-utopia-bold fonts used in the tool, so
	it at least loaded for me (I am not sure about this, but I
	have no, say, font -adobe-utopia-bold-r-normal-*-13-*-*-*-p-*-*-*).

	Uff! This can't be done in CVS. It seems that the only solution
	is to remove this file on the server, even the command
		cvs admin -o1 themes/default/background

	So, I have added themes/default/background.d instead...

	can we know before dropping if the dropping is not forbidden?
	The changes in fvwm-themes-config have almost an empty intersection
 	with the "old" code. Mikhael, feel free to do all the changes
	you want. The intersection is a modification in themes-rc-2:
	a menu entries for the ThemesCenter in the Theme Management
	menu.

	info for developers

2000-08-07  migo  <migo@homemail.com>

	* forms/FvwmForm-ThemeSettings:
	removed fvwm-themes-config string.
	Using this form freezes fvwm for me, Ctrl-Alt-Esc helps. Again?

	* forms/FvwmGtk-Themes:
	Temporary config until we have fvwm-themes-gtk (not before 0.4.0).
	We should use FvwmGtk aliases for all our gtk menus, I think,
	or we should implement module config delimiter in fvwm ASAP.
	The name FvwmGtk-Themes means that all gtk-based fvwm-themes dialogs
	may be defined in this file, but this is unclear yet.

	* themes/default/menus:
	Added "AddToMenu MenuFvwmPersonal" to avoid warning.
	Added FvwmGtk-Themes:SettingsDialog.

	When I choose sound-player (play, esd), FvwmEvent (I suppose) does
	not respond (fvwm freezes) and is killed after 30 seconds timeout.

	Added these 2 big files, I am not sure where to use them if at all.

2000-07-28  olicha  <olivier.chapuis@free.fr>

	* themes/multichoice/backgrounds/*
	Add some fvwm-themes-images background and replace xv + bggen when

	* bin/fvwm-themes-images.in: fix a random pattern bug
     
2000-07-28  migo  <migo@homemail.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	Removed --remove-popup in fvwm-themes-menuapp when creating menus
	(I am not really sure why this was needed).
	Remove CVS directories (if any) on installing, not the best solution.

	* cvs:
	updates to the cvs wrapper.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-menuapp.in:
	Nothing important, maybe spaces, I will not comment trivial

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config.in:
	a few "modules massive renaming" fixes
	FvwmScript-NoteMessage was called as scripts/FvwmScript-NoteMessage
	so no theme switch without ctl-alt-escape ...

	* themes/redmond98/background/*
	use 8bits hex nbr in the place of the X name for colors 
	(for speed: win 5%).

	* bin/fvwm-themes-images.in:
	clean up and speed the code (note the --be-fast option for
	cde-sky). Complete the man page.
	
2000-07-27  migo  <migo@homemail.com>

	* configure.in:
	Increased version to 0.2.13.
	Imported fvwm-themes to CVS!

2000-07-26  migo  <migo@homemail.com>

	* themes/cde/background/pattern:
	Moved from incorrect name. I think more paterns may be included
	as options later.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-images.in:
	fixed some indentation and some typos, including an error disabling
	evaluating 'shadow' colors; several perl tweaks.
	Renamed --info-xcolors to --show-xcolors, --info-all-colors to
	--show-xcolorsets, --info-color to --show-color-info; 2 functions
	formatColorInfo[Head]Line().

	* */*:
	% find . | perl -wne 'chomp; if (-s && -T && `tail -1 $_` !~ /\n$/s) \
		{ print "$_\n"; system("echo >>$_") }'
	Make sure all our text files have final EOLN. Please configure your
	editor to force this. In emacs: (setq require-final-newline t).

	* themes/*/background/*:
	Removed comment.

	* themes/migo/background:
	* themes/migo/images/background/cyan-tile.png:
	renamed from .pmg to .png.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config.in:
	* themes/*/*.cfg:
	Renamed 'global' to 'priority' and 'popup' to 'inline' (inverted
	meaning, and now inline=0, i.e. prior popup=1, is the default).
	Implemented 'option-read-afterward' component value, default is 0.
	Uncommented "+ I DestroyModuleConfig FvwmTheme*" to fix flickering.
	Fixed memory of options.

	* themes/default/theme.cfg:
	Added requires+=colorsets to bindings@ for Shift-Alt-F12 for example.
	Added requires+=MouseXX to buttons@.

	* themes/*/theme.cfg:
	Added this file. Currently if a theme has no theme.cfg, default's
	file is used and it is cached (to get a better performance), so
	--fresh will not work in this case. I may think about this later.

	* themes/default/functions-appbind:
	* themes/settings/stroke/enable:
	Added FuncFvwmQuitVerify instead of QuitVerify form.

	themes/default/menus-user:
	uncommented "xiterm 80x40" menu item

	* themes/default/bindings:
	* themes/*/buttons:
	s/FuncFvwmActionOrWindowsOps/FuncFvwmWindowsOpsOrAction/

	* themes/blackbox/modules/main:FvwmButtons-XX:
	Change global Frame 0 once instead of everywhere in button items.

	* themes/default/modules*:
	Use options for modules (was subcomponents of choices).
	Some renamings, probably not perfect.

	* themes/*/modules*:
	Renamed 'Use Icons' to 'Use Normal Icons' to be less ambiguous,
	s/FuncFvwmStartIcons/FuncFvwmStartNormalIcons/.
	Several other renamings, like s/buttons/buttonbar/.

	* themes/migo/modules*:
	Implemented modules@ options: winlist and normal-icons.
	Heh, module configs are linked to @olicha, and options to @default.

	* */*:
	Total renaming of all module aliases to a new name scheme:
	FvwmModule-SubName. This should be done in fvwm itself too. :-)
	Several (a lot, in fact) corrections during this total renaming.
	Just an idea, how about an alias/wrapper FvwmApplet -> FvwmScript?
	Experimentally install scripts/* and forms/* to flat FT_DATADIR,
	so invocation now does not require scripts/ prefix. I still think
	that flat structure is not good, but probably ok for now, also if
	SearchPath is introduced, we can put FT_DATADIR/scripts to it.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config.in:
	- Fixed loading *-extra and other components, which are not yet in
	the current theme.
	- Add Drop/Info menu items to all components even complex ones.
	- Replaced memory implementation (removed 8 functions, added 2),
	memory is stored in _core component.
	- Now HASH in HASH in .cfg is supported too (represented by ':').
	- I had no time to learn why 'used' is needed and to get rid of it.

	* themes/migo/modules/*:
	Added options as an alternative way to how choices are handled
	in olicha/default themes.
	Changed Pager sizes, unfortunately there is a problem in FvwmPager.

	* themes/migo/background:
	* themes/migo/images/background/cyan-tile.pmg:
	New image, still not exactly what I want. :)

	* themes/default/bindings:
	* themes/*/buttons:
	Restored motif behavior of WindowsOps menu, it is possible to
	change it in personal bindings-extra or functions-extra.
	Renamed FuncFvwmActionOrWindowsOps2 to FuncFvwmActionOrWindowsOps,
	maybe someone wants to popup WindowsOps here immediately.

	* themes/*/colors[/*]:
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config.in:
	Finally moved 'ModuleSynchronous FvwmTheme' to core.

	* themes/*/sound:

	* themes/*/modules/main:
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config.in:
	FvwmEvent for sounds now started/stoped as 'FvwmEvent FvwmSoundEvent',
	this enables us to run other event modules.
	FuncFvwmStopModuleByAlias now requires 2 parameters (was 1).
	FuncFvwmRestartModuleByAlias now accepts an optional 3-rd parameter.

	* themes/default/menus-user:
	Moved some apps from my personal menus (I don't have all of them). 
	Games will be added later. There should be added support for
	ViewFile & EditFile, just like ViewFileTail.

2000-06-28  olicha  <olivier.chapuis@free.fr>

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config.in:
	- Added support for (non permanent) sub component ("contains" cfg
 	command). 
	- Added a "memory stuff" for options and choices, this
	use a memory.cfg file in the user current theme directory.
	- Now only the only *.cfg file that are "automatically" load
	in the default file are theme.cfg and setting.cfg (this allows
	the default theme to get its own sub component, for modules
	for examples).
	Note: The new code is marked by a "# olicha" so that it is easy for 
	you Mikhael to see the diff. Of course most of these marks have to
	be removed in the future.
	The new "memory" code can be merged with the 'cc' code at a lot of 
	places, but I've prefered to use a more prudent method for lisibility
	and leave this for the future.

	* themes/{olicha,default}/modules.cfg:
	* themes/{olicha,default}/modules/*:
	Implemented "theme modules settings" for olicha and default.
	Will continue with the other themes if every body are happy

	Get{Min,Max}Value instructions.

	* themes/default/settings.cfg:
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config.in
	stroke requires bindings. Added a new cfg command "external-imagepath".

	* themes/*/button:
	* themes/default/bindings:
	Completed the 2<->3 mouse switching
	New function FuncFvwmActionOrWindowsOps2: first arg for one click
	WindowsOps2 for double click.
	Use the above functions when needed, but use Delete in the place of
	FuncFvwmDelete since if I use it I've got a:
	 [FVWM][ExecuteFunction]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'FuncFvwmDelete'
	I'm quite confused with variable expansion ...
	
	* themes/default/functions:
	"Fix" FuncFvwmIconifySameResource: replace C by I
	
	* themes/default/bindings*:
	* themes:default/settings/stroke/enable:

	FuncFvwmMoveOrRaiseLower does not work with stroke replace it
	by RasieLower in this case (stroke + 2<->3=yes)
	
	* bin/fvwm-tehemes-menuapp.in

	Added --show-dir parameter.
	--fresh parameter (i.e. Refresh the current theme) now preserves
	current options and choices.
	
2000-05-27  migo  <migo@homemail.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am:
	fixed installing scripts/ directory

	* Makefile.am:
	* {images,sounds}.tar.gz:
	images and sounds are now distributed in .tar.gz, so we have

	Added some useful (IMHO) macros.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config.in:
	Use 'PipeRead' to read itself instead of 'Exec' + 'Wait'.

	calls fvwm-themes-config --reset to reset a user version.

	* themes/default/bindings:
	* options/stroke/enabled:
	FuncFvwmResizeOrRaise is now FuncFvwmResizeOrRaiseOrShade.
	This was once suggested by Dominik, to shade on border double click.
	Alt-Mouse3 in borders/title, now like Alt-Mouse3 in window.

	* themes/default/bindings:
	* themes/default/menus:
	Small changes in some main window operation bibdings, now they are

	* README:
	Fixed a non-fatal error when the current personal theme is not found.

	(reported by Jason).

2000-04-05  migo  <migo@homemail.com>

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	* images/*/*:
	Moved bb-*, osx-* and migo-* images back to the local places.
	Now colors component requires local images/decor and images/menuback.

	* themes/migo/colors: added sh and hi colors to active menu colorset

	* themes/default/menus: added the void definition of MenuFvwmPersonal
	back (it is ok, menus-my or similar should require menus).

	* themes/default/menus-programs:
	removed duplications in MenuFvwmInternet

	* themes/migo/modules/main:
	Replaced not working -x wm-icons-config test with another one.

	* themes/default/menus:
	Added MenuFvwmWindowRefresh, MenuFvwmWindowUtility submenus
	with additional (hopefully useful) window operations.

	* themes/default/startup: component renamed, was "start".

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	* scripts/ScriptNoteMessage:
	* themes/default/styles:
	Script renamed from ScriptUtilsMessage and moved hardcoded title.

	* themes/default/styles:
	Temporarily added DefaultColorset, until a permanent place.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	Moved windowlook to read-first components, because Style * BorderWidth
	should be before other BorderWidth styles (in styles* components).

	* options/stroke/enabled:
	added one additional binding for each calculator and www; rewordings.

	* options/iconstyles/iconstyles: slightly updated

	* themes/migo/cursors: added STROKE cursor (plus is not good IMHO)

	* themes/default/menus:
	* themes/default/bindings:
	Small changes in WindowOps2 menu (hopefully imporovements):
	replaced Delete & Destroy with Close, Restore item now restores
	maximizing and shading, not only iconifying.
	Replaced FuncFvwmMaximize or FuncFvwmIconify with Maximize and
	Iconify in WindowOps2, we should have the real operations here.
	Fixed cut&paste errors in MenuFvwmWindowStyle.

	* themes/default/menus:
	* themes/redmond98/modules/main:startmenu:
	Added links to fvwm and fvwm-themes home pages.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	banner options is now on by default,
	s/FuncFvwmOptionsUse/FuncFvwmThemesUseOption/

	* themes/*/colors:
	massive clean up (more is needed), added the colorset for FvwmScroll
	and 5 colorsets for different terminal types.

	* scripts/ScriptNoteMessage: use colorset 0 (feedback window)
	* themes/default/{functions,functions-appbind,menus,bindings}:
	Use own colorsets for special function windows, xterms, root xterms
	and FvwmConsole; ShowMessage uses FvwmForm's colorset.

	* themes/osx/modules/main:FvwmMenuBarButtons:
	Fixed position of one submenu, small renaming.

	* Makefile:
	On installation, if found, personal themes is copied from the
	existing (old) themes/ and --use'd. This may cause compatibility
	problems when personal theme is not up to date...

	* themes/blackbox/images/menuback/face.xpm:
	Reduced number of colors and fixed one buggy black line.
	We should support guys with 8bpp. blackbox/images/decor/* should be
	reduced/improved too...

	* themes/*/windowlook:
	All files are minimized and now have the same format.
	I have removed headers, because I don't think that theme name should
	be inside fixed-format "look" components. Of course, I may be wrong.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	* themes/blackbox/images/modulecolor/*:
	Moved images used in colors component from module/ to modcolor/.

	* themes/awol/*:
	Added new awol theme from Alex after massive editing.
	Crazy colors and sounds. :-)

2000-03-19  olicha  <olivier.chapuis@free.fr>

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	* options/session/{regular,gnome}:
	* themes/afterstep/modules/main:FvwmIconMan:
	* doc/FAQ:
	Fix (I hope) the "session hang". Weakned the Session support now
 	GNOME is not auto detected: you need to choose your session support
	as an option (gnome is the default). The definition of
	FuncFvwmFvwmOrSessionOrGnome is in the new files 
	options/session/{regular,gnome} and use perl in the place of
	the shell.

	* themes/blackbox/buttons,colors,images/
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	Try to fix blackbox "colors". New global function (in themes-rc) 
	FuncFvwmIfModules mod action1 action2
	where mod is the name of a modules theme, action1 is executed if
	the curre nt modules is mod and action2 is executed if not.
	This function used in colors to load either the pixmap 
	module/TheToolbar700.xpm or a gradient for colorset 10.

	* themes/default/menus: Fix the root xterm

	* themes/default/style: added a style for ScriptUtilsMessage and
	gnome icons.

	* themes/osx/desktop: Fix GlobalOptions !

	* themes/olicha/modules/main:FvwmXappletButtons:
	* themes/redmond98/modules/main:FvwmBarButtons:

	be read before any layer command.

	* script/{ScriptUtilsMessage,README}:
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	A new script for displaying a message during theme switch.
	
2000-03-14  olicha  <olivier.chapuis@free.fr>

	* themes/afterstep/modules/main:FvwmAsButtons: Added a
	panel of applets. Fix some geometries

	* themes/afterstep/modules/main:FvwmAsButtons:
	* themes/osx/modules/main:FvwmOsx*:
	* themes/olicha/modules/FvwmWMakerButtons,FvwmXappletsButtons
	Some Colorset improvement since now "individual button colorset"
	work :). Fix some geometries.
	
	* scripts/ScriptApplet*: some fixes

	* themes/*/{colors,menustyles}:
	Use MenuStyle * MenuColorset 3, ActiveColorset 4, GreyedColorset 5
	in colors and remove the colors definition of menustyle.
	Add colorset 17 for FvwmIdent (blackbox colorset 17 use Transparent :)
	Fix missprint in comments

	* themes/default/menus: do not destroy the personal menu

	* options/banner/*:
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	Re-added Banner option

	* themes/default/start
	* themes/default/sound
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	"New file" start options/current/{animation, banner, background} 
	are now read in this file.
	options/current/sound is read in themes/default/sound

	* options/gnome/anotherlevel-menu:
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	Added AnotherLevel menu as a gnome option (wmconfig which generate
	directly such a fvwm2 menu is not usable since the menus are not
	distroyed ...)

	* themes/default/menus: replace Pick by Pick (CirculateHit) so that
	the menu MenuFvwmWindowStyle applies also to modules!

	* themes/module/olicha/modules/main:FvwmWMButtons
	* themes/module/olicha/modules/main:FvwmXappletsButtons
	CirculateHit/Skip fixes.

	* themes/blackbox/{colors,buttons}

	* themes/blackbox/images/button/*
	* themes/images/decor/bb-left-button-back:
	* themes/images/decor/bb-right-button-back:
	Better compatibility of balckbox theme with the other themes.
	Need to fix 
	* themes/*/modules/*
	* script/*
	Fix the colors of some swallowed apps. For the ScriptApplet*
	the best colorsets options is 6 7 or 7.

	* themes/osx/modules/main:FvwmMenuBarButtons:
	Use the inactive menu color as the main color

	* themes/olicha/desktop: allows some horizontal scrolling

	* themes/osx/modules/main:FvwmOsxButtons:
	* themes/blackbox/main:FvwmXXButtons:
	* options/autoraise/modules:
	The Previous functions work in the "same way" with the MouseFocus
	or NeverFocus or ClickToFocus style, so there are no more problems
	with autoraise/modules option.

	in FvwmButtons buttons so that editing this file change the
	applications started by these buttons in all themes :)
	These functions are also used in menu and in a well configurated
 	FvwmTaskBar (for the mail) and some functions from
	themes/default/functions have been moved in this file.
	The defaults are not very intelligent! Any comments and changes
	are welcome. Any way this file has been done for edition!

	* themes/redmond98/main:FvwmDesker: fixed size of the desker vs
	the size of the buttons that popup the Desker

	* themes/osx/images/buttons/*: try to fix the buttons on a dark
	background

	* themes/osx/colors: fixed active menu colorset

	* themes/*/windowlook: renamed "decorations" by "windowlook"

	* options/stroke/{disabled,enabled}:
	* doc/FAQ:
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	Added support for stroke. options/current/stroke is read by
 	themes/default/bindings.

	* options/iconstyles/wm-icons:imagepath:

	All the icons styles is now in one file options/iconstyles/iconstyles.
	native just ask to read this file and wm-icons read this file plus
	wm-icons:menu. Moreover, options/current/iconstyles is read in
	themes/*/styles. Of course, minor change in fvwm-themes-config was 
	needed. Note that options/iconstyles/wm-icons:imagepath is "read
	first" when needed and fvwm-themes-config control that.

	* themes/default/menus:
	* themes/default/menus-programs:
	* themes/redmond98/modules/main:startmenu:
	* images/winXX-startmenu/personal.xpm:
	Move MenuFvwmPrograms in themes/default/menus-programs and add to
	many entries, but my idea here is to do a very very big menu 
	(witout gnome and kde apps) and to do a perl script that parse it
 	to retain only the installed applications.
	Add a MenuFvwmPersonal menu.

	* themes/wm-icons/*
	* themes/migo/modules/*
	Move wm-icons into migo
	
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	* options/gnome/panel-staysput/{enable,disabled}:
	Added an option that try to force the panel to be StaysPut.
	This does not work perfectly, currently I need to slide/unslide
	the panel before the option work. Also, the option is not 
	really "dynamic" (even after a restart).
	Note: Currently I've a problem with the panel it start only
	20sec after fvwm finish its startup!
	
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:

	* themes/afterstep/main:FvwmIconman:
	* themes/default/bindings:
	* themes/default/menu:
	* themes/default/style:
	* options/autoraise/modules:
	Added Session/Gnome support. In themes-rc there is a new function
	FuncFvwmFvwmOrSessionOrGnome, this function take 3 arguments, the 
	first argument is executed if fvwm is started "alone", the second 
	argument is executed if fvwm is started via a session manager but 
	gnome and the 3rd one is executed if fvwm is started via a gnome 
	session. See FuncFvwmThemesConfigAndUpdate (for theme switching),
	themes/default/menu: (for exiting), themes/default/bindings (for
	gnome button) and themes/afterstep/main:FvwmIconman, for some
	example of use of this function.
	Moreover, themes (switching) is NoSession/Session award for the 
	modules themes (not NoSession/Session/Gnome award, but we can do 
	that if we think we need that). The fvwm session init function
	are used, of course, and there is a FuncFvwmSessionStartThemeModules
	function. In general, under session less modules are started and
	in fact I've done that so that a default panel does not overlap with
	some fvwm modules ...
	Notes: - in menu "Yes, Really Quit" and "Yes, Quit & Save Session" do
	not work under xsm. We may define a FuncFvwmFvwmOrSessionOrGnomeOrXsm
	if one ask for a true xsm support. However, I've added a style line
	for xsm.
 	- We may try to be more session/gnome award, e.g., redefines
	FormFvwmQuitVerify and do some options session award (e.g.,
	background: disabled, disabled for session, theme ...)
	- Todo: add the option for gnome: dynamic desk (default) /
 	4 desks (GnomeShowDesks 4).

	* themes/*/colors:
	* themes/*/decorations:
	* themes/*/menustyles:
	* themes/*/modules/*:
	* themes/default/functions
	* themes/default/menus
	* images/{decor,menuback}:
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	First minimal implementation of "colors".
	colors defines all the colors for a theme and use FvwmTheme.
	It must be readed before decorations, menustyles, buttons,
	menu and modules/main (and any file that may use a colorset).
	Read a colors file for details !
	fvwm-themes-config change: replaced decorations by colors at line 576,
	added FuncFvwmStopFvwmThem in FuncFvwmThemesConfigAndUpdate.
	I'm really sorry but I put back to the global images directory
	the decor (osx, migo, blackbox) and the menuback (osx, blackbox).
	I do that because I cannot modify fvwm-themes-config so that
	fvwm-themes-config computes the good image path.
        I've changed the colors of aftersetp: the colors are taken from
	afterstep 1.8.
	Of course there are some bugs in the implementation. Some came
	from fvwm itself (there are bugs in FvwmPager and FvwmButtons
	Colorset implementation). These lead me some times to do bad
	coding (e.g., osx/modules/main:FvwmOsxButtons) or to do things
	that I do not like for colors (e.g., afterstep/modules/main:
	FvwmAsButtons).
	
	* themes/blackbox: Try to do so that blackbox is more compatible 
	with the other themes. Still need a lot of work !

	* themes/afterstep/modules/*: Added an afterstep modules theme 
	("from" afterstep 1.8)
	
	* themes/afterstep/background: Added a background

	* themes/afterstep/buttons: Fixed the "menu button" bindings

	* images/button: Replaced the as-window-iconify.xpm by the one 
	in afterstep 1.8.

	* themes/osx/modules/*: Added a modules theme (need FvwmM4)

	* themes/osx/background: Added a background

	* themes/osx/desktop: Emulate mwm (better for the modules theme)

	* scripts/*: small fixes

	* README, NEWS: updated
	
2000-02-15  migo  <migo@homemail.com>

	Preparing the first public alpha release.
	All initial documentation and README's updated.

	* themes/default/functions:
	minor changes to FuncFvwm{Iconify,Maximize[VH]*}.
	Moved FuncFvwmIconifySameResource from default/bindings.
	FuncFvwmShowMessage has title parameter, new FuncFvwmShowButtonInfo.
	New configurable FuncFvwmRunInXterm.

	* themes/*/buttons:
	Renamed FuncFvwm s/ShowMessage/ShowButtonInfo/,
	now EOLN is ^n, TAB is ^t in the messages to avoid quoting problems.

	* themes/*/*:
	Renamed FuncFvwm s/ManPager/ViewManPage/, s/FileViewer/ViewFile/,
	s/FileEditor/EditFile/, s/WebBrowser/OpenURL/.

	* themes/default/menus: added MenuFvwmSystem.

	* themes/*/modules/main:{FvwmTaskBar,FvwmIconMan}:
	fixed/added 'Popup MenuFvwmWindowOps2 Mouse c -102m' as Mouse3 action.
	* themes/*/modules/main:FvwmWinList:
	fixed/added 'Popup MenuFvwmWindowOps2 Mouse -105m c' as Mouse3 action.

	* fvwm-themes-config:
	minor changes (like '*' instead of '+' for the current option);
	init functions are now destroyed on theme switch to save memory.

	* options/iconstyles/*: minor updates from wm-icons package.

	* images/16x16-general/ball-*.xpm: removed unused icons.

	* themes/default/bindings:
	Added experimental support for folks without mouse button 2 -
	simulate some Mouse2 bindings on decorations/window by Ctrl-Mouse1.

	* scripts/*:

	Fixed "Normal icons" menu entry.

2000-02-10  migo  <migo@homemail.com>

	* themes/default/menus:
	moved configuration menus up, X config forms are now in FVWM config.
	fvwm-menu-xlock option --icon replaced with --icon-item.

	* themes/redmond98/background:
	changed ms flame to flying fvwm, why should we mention ms at all?..

	* images/{16x16,48x48}-general: updated from the latest developement
	version of wm-icons.

	* images/:
	Created new alias bar to enable wm-icons theme without wm-icons
	package being installed; removed decor/; renamed module/ to 32x32/.
	updated 32x32/image-viewer.xpm icon.
	* images/16x16-general:
	Renamed ball-*.xpm; new kde.xpm; gnome.xpm 86 colors reduced to 20.

	* Renamed image alias module/mini to 16x16 everywhere.
	This is half-fixed way, i.e. there is a possibility to change to
	other 16x16 icon set, like 16x16-kde, for real fixed way -
	use the real icon set names, i.e. 16x16-general/xterm.xpm.
	* themes/olicha/modules/main:FvwmStartAppsButtons
	Similarly changed mini/ to 16x16/, since the geometry is fixed.

	* Moved images for migo and osx themes to the local places, it is
	unbeliviable that these images could be reused anyway.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	Now image dirs are not listed in component list, image dir links
	are updated automatically when needed (some hardcoding for now).
	New rc files are now named themes-rc and themes-rc-2.

	* themes/olicha/modules/main:FvwmStartWinOpsButtons: replaced
	close action with delete, because there is destroy, is it ok?

	* themes/redmond98/modules/:
	main:FvwmTaskBar: fixed the menu position;
	Problem: all pagers are not proportional; set DeskTopSize to 3x2?

	* themes/*/theme.xml: removed currently before the real solution.

	* themes/wm-icons/modules/main:FvwmMyPagerButtons:
	Added a new module. Problem: FvwmPager should accept -g!
	Now used again absolute geometry for pager, since there is FvwmDesker.

	* themes/default/bindings:
	Shift-Ctrl-Mouse2 now calls FvwmDesker, not FvwmPager,
	Shift-Alt-Tab now is supplement (skip) version of Alt-Tab,
	removed Escape bindings, minor changes to icon bindings.

	* themes/*/buttons:
	some standardization changes, swapped MenuFvwmWindowMove and
	MenuFvwmWindowGroupOps bindings (I hope it's ok), deleted modifiers,
	tried to use only customizable functions and not real commands.
	Imlemented inline button help using Ctrl-Alt + click on button.

	* themes/default/functions:
	New functions: FuncFvwmShowMessage, FuncFvwmIconify, FuncFvwmDelete,
	FuncFvwmMaximizeVertically, FuncFvwmMaximizeHorizontally.

	* images/*/penguin.xpm, themes/*/modules/main:FvwmTaskBar:
	Replaced to be 16x16 and moved from winXX-startmenu/ to 16x16/ dir.

	* doc/FAQ, doc/README.1st, AUTHORS, COPYING:
	Created some initial documentation and standard files.

2000-02-03  olicha  <olivier.chapuis@free.fr>

	* themes/olicha/modules/*: Added olicha modules themes. Need some
	works ...
	* themes/olicha/README: Added help instructions.
	* themes/*/desktop: Replaced GlobalOpts by the new stryles. Hope
	that dominik will not change ClickToFocusClickRaises.
	* images/modules/mini: added mini which is a symlink to 16x16-general
	so that we can use "fixed icons" in modules (i.e., not dependent on
	wm-icons).
	* themes/redmond98/modules/main:FvwmBarButtons:
	Use "fixed icons" for the win ops container
	* themes/redmond98/modules/main: Fixed a missprint
	* themes/default/functions: Removed FuncFvwmRemoveAllButtons since
	it is in rc.
	* themes/default/menus: Again modules ...
	* options/sound/*: added an entries in Regular modules menus (if
	the option is not disabled)
	* options/autoraise/modules: added an entries in Regular modules menu
	(if the option is enabled), and remove one in Theme modules menu.

	* makefile
	* scripts/: 
	New directories (global :) for scripts
	* scripts/ScriptAppletDay: an AS & WM compatible applet for the
	day (need date). Work in progress !
	* script/ScriptAppletMixer: an AS & WM compatible applet to control
	sound (need aumix). Work in progress !
	Currently, the background is blue, maybe we can reserve a colorset
	for the applets background ?

2000-02-03  olicha  <olivier.chapuis@free.fr>

	* themes/*/modules/*: 
	* themes/default/menus:
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config (hard coded part):
	Some of the modules are restarted and not only started, add
	functions FuncFvwmRestartModule and FuncFvwmRestartModuleByAlias
	in rc (there are always used so ...). Also move FuncFvwmRemoveButtons.
	Do some modifications about modules menus ... Do not know if this
	ok.

	* themes/default/bindings:
 	* themes/*/buttons:
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config (hard coded part):
	New function FuncFvwm{RemoveBindings,ButtonsBindings} that remove 
	the bindings.
	These functions are used by FuncFvwmThemesConfigAndUpdate

	* themes/*/modules/*:
	Use FvwmDesker alias for the 4 desks pagers. 
	Since desktop is now in modules the MenuFvwmMoveWindow is with
	DesktopSize (i.e.: with the pager config) and with the Desker
	config if there are a move between desk menu entries.

	* themes/modules/balackbox/*: Some fixes. Do not now if there
	are ok. Details: 
	- Added Style * NoIcon, 
	- Remove Style * MiniIcon aicon and put false for iconman miniicon
	(the result is not very different and this is need for that the stuff 
	works with other themes).
	- A Config for a desker. Need to add Toolbar100.xpm
	
	* themes/default/menus: Add MenuFvwmEditors in MenuFvwmPrograms

	* options/*:
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config (hard coded part):
	Now current contains symlink with fixed name which is the
	name of the "working" directories. The options are ready to
	be started independently via some functions: 
	FuncFvwm{Stop,Start}Option{Animate,Sound, ...}

	* images/16x16-general: added kde.xpm and gnome.xpm. 
	Of course this cause a problem with wm-icons.

	* themes/*/buttons:
	* themes/*/decorations:
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config (getThemeComponentList,sortThemeComponent):
	Try to do so that buttons and decorations of different themes work
	together. Main idea: put the definitions of the colors of the 
	buttons in decorations and put the TitleStyle Height in buttons.
	Moreover, decorations are now readed before buttons: this leads
	to 3 new lines in fvwm-themes-config.
	I've gotten Some difficulty to really destroy the previous buttons 
	definitions. Also, I and we will need to edit some buttons and
	decor.

2000-01-25  migo  <migo@homemail.com>

	* themes/blackbox: added new theme from Jos

	* themes/default/menus: several additions and "improvements"

	* themes/*/{desktop,modules/main}: moved DeskTopSize from desktop
	to modules (FvwmPager)

	* themes/wm-icons/modules/main:FvwmPager: specifying the size for the
	pager is not very good, FvwmPagerDeskTopScale is better, this is
	needed for Ctrl-Mouse2 and Ctrl-Shift-Mouse2 to work propertly;
	but now probably the pager is too small on small monitors...

	* everywhere (many places):
	s/FuncFvwmSt{op,art}ModulesTheme/FuncFvwmSt{op,art}ThemeModules/
	s/FuncFvwmSt{op,art}BackgroundTheme/FuncFvwmSt{op,art}ThemeBackground/
	s/MenuFvwmModulesTheme/MenuFvwmStartThemeModules/,
	s/MenuFvwmStopModule/MenuFvwmStopRegularModules/,
	added menus MenuFvwmStartRegularModules and MenuFvwmStopThemeModules.
	Regular modules are all normal modules, which should run out of box.
	The modules menu is rearanged (more structured now).

	* themes/default/modules/main: moved modules config to separate files;
	removed session initialization functions, it may be confusing not to
	get anything in gnome and it is ok to use both panel and modules,
	just not with every theme (wm-icons modules work well with panel).

	* themes/*/modules/main:
	Tried to keep the files in the same order.

	* images/: winXX startmenu icons moved to winXX-startmenu/

	* themes/default/functions:
	added FuncFvwmWebBrowser to view web documents
	* themes/redmond98/modules:startmenu:
	used FuncFvwmWebBrowser and added some menu icons

2000-01-25  migo  <migo@homemail.com>

	* NEWS, TODO: new files added

	* Renamed audiofiles/ to sounds/ everywhere.
	* options/iconstyles/standard: renamed to ./native.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	--expand option is added for external use;
	some clean up in hard-coded parts, rewrite is needed;
	prefix "+" instead of postfix "(current)" for options, should I use
	this also for themes instead of "(used)"?

	* makefile: backup fvwm-themes-config during instalation. I was
	angry when all my changes (for 2 days) were lost today...

	* themes/default/menus:
	some rearrangements and optimizations in window option menus,
	most of the menus now have mini icon, I am not very happy about this,
	more work on icons is needed.

	* wm-icons: added pager configuration and small clean up;
	Renamed CompactButtons to FvwmCompactButtons.

	* images/: removed unneded .xvpics/ and .directory.

	* themes/*/*: small rearrangements in functions and menus.

2000-01-24  olicha  <olivier.chapuis@free.fr>

	* themes/redmond98/modules/main:FvwmBarButtons:
	Resize a lit bit.

	* themes/olicha/desktop: was forgetted.

	* Move all the icons into images/ and update the following files
	so that things work: afterstep/buttons, migo/decorations,
	olicha/{background,buttons}, osx/{menustyle,decorations}
	redmond98/{background,buttons,modules/main:FvwmBarButtons,
	modules/main:FvwmTaskBar,modules/main:startmenu}

	* Added 48x48-general and a general directories which is a
 	superset of 16x16-general. Added symlink: norm --> 48x48 and
	menu,mini --> general. These stuff is allways in the imagepath,
	but it is wm-icons compatible (wm-icons can over-write the icons
	names).
	
	* fvwm-themes-config:
	Change $imagePath so that the above change works.

	* Now what follows is an experimental (big) stuff:
	Added a new top directory called options/ that gives support for:
	- Animation (started or not started)
	- Sound effect (started with esdplay, rplay, or rplayd or not started,
	it will be easy to use others sound players. This does not define the
	sounds effect, only defines if FvwmEvent start or not and also
 	defines the sound player).
	- Modules Auto raise.
	- Background: use the theme bacground or not. It can be session/
	nosession sensitive and take in account the backer in the future.
	- iconstyle: standard, wm-icons, or disabled (disabled not work). 
	- KDE: various kde menu (with styles support or not). KFM bugoptions.
	- Gnome: various gnome menu (gtk or fvwm).

	All these allow to suppress the following files/dir in themes/:
	default/start, default/iconstyle, fvwm-icons/, {disable}/, 
	olicha/modules/modules-auto-raise, wm-icons/iconstyle.
	 
	Also, it needs a very bad hack of fvwm-themes-config: I've
	indicate the news stuff by "# New nbr.lines/bloc". It is bad
	because: 1. Stuff is hard coded 2. Identation is not compatible
	(never succeed to do so that a good .emacs for perl work ...).
	But an important point is that the stuff work :) and to be not
	hard coded a kind of options.xml is needed ...

	* Added default/sound and .fvwm/audiofiles/ with 4 audiofiles and
	some symlinks (I'm happy with this sound, but add_window.au). I
	think that in the futur we can done theme "a la wm-icons":
	some sound directories and symlinks from the "action" to some
	sounds.

	* default/menus and redmond98/modules/main:startmenu:
	replace MenuFvwmUtilities by MenuFvwmPrograms and put "Utilities"
	one level down with MenuFvwmGraphics and MenuFvwmInternet.
	This change is needed by the KDE/Gnome menu stuff.
	
	* Added "BusyCursor DynamicMenu True" in ALL themes/menustyle.

	* Update the makefile: images, options, audiofiles are installed
	and "uninstalled" as themes.

	* README: suppress the note about fvwm-icons :)
	
2000-01-18  migo  <migo@homemail.com>

	* themes/*:
	Many small corrections in menus, functions, spacing and wording.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	Now 2 files are created: rc and rc2. .fvwm2rc is obsolete again. :)
	'env FVWM_USERHOME=~/.fvwm fvwm2 -f rc' is needed to start fvwm.
	rc file contains some functions to use/reset themes and loads rc2.
	Added --generate-rc and --xmessage (internal) options.
	ModulePath is now set in rc2 file, like ImagePath.
	Added README for each theme, is this needed?

	* themes/*/background:
	Renamed [Func]FvwmQuitBackgroundTheme to FuncFvwmStopBackgroundTheme
	and image subdir background/ to rootback/ (?).
	-mod 2x2 background changed to solid (looks better for move/resize).

	* themes/*/menustyles:
	Renamed to menustyle, initially I thought to put there not only *
	but also WindowList etc., but this should be thought later.
	All menustyle files have the same format (everything, but colorsets).

	* themes/*/{decorations,desktop}:
	Tried to keep the files in the same order.

	* themes/redmond98/images/modules/*: renamed to largebar/,
	Shrinked all 34x34 images to 32x32; striped the signature of
	netscape.xpm; replaced kview.xpm (image.xpm) from kde2 (too much
	colors) with the one from kde1; replaced term.xpm, other changes.
	More work is probably needed.
	* themes/redmond98/images/button/*:
	* themes/redmond98/buttons:
	Renamed s/winXX./window-/ to be wm-icons compatible.
	* themes/redmond98/modules:
	Renamed *.main files to main:* - probably temporarily.
	* themes/redmond98/modules/*:
	* themes/redmond98/images/*:
	Renamed some image subdirs, removed module path prefix.

	* themes/olicha/modules/modulesauto:
	Renamed to auto-raise-modules (?).
	* themes/olicha/images/button/*:
	* themes/olicha/buttons:
	Renamed s/mac./window-/ to be wm-icons compatible.

	* themes/default/bindings: added transient pager to root, restored
	previous bindings to borders (mouse 1 & 2) until we get a consensus

	* themes/default/menu: restored some things about WindowStyle menu

	* themes/osx/*: added new theme

	* themes/wm-icons/modules/main: last minute change: the alias 'button'
	used by CompactButtons renamed to 'bar' (smallbar better?).
	I will rename with in the next version of wm-icons too.

	NOTE: I restored/changed several things (I was too busy), but this
	does not mean I am against these things, it just means that
	I suggest it differently. Feel free to re-restore again. :)

	TODO: I didn't change wm-icons theme, I will.

2000-01-15  olicha  <olivier.chapuis@free.fr>
 	
	* ChangeLog: Creating this file

	* README:
	* Makefile:
 	* New file system.fvwm2rc
	Temporary (?) change. I added a .fvwm2rc file for
	theme switching (needed for modules theme switching and also
	background switching).
	So fvwm-themes with this version need to be started by:
	          env FVWM_USERHOME=~/.fvwm fvwm2
	Any way, I think that a file that is read only at (re)start is
	a good thing: We surely need some functions that are always
	needed (e.g., FuncFvwmRemoveButtons, FuncFvwmRestartModule, ...).
	
	* themes/Redmond98/*: Add windoze98 theme, most part came from 
	system.fvwm2rc-sample-95 or will be in it. 

	* themes/olicha/*: My theme ...
	
	* themes/default/menus:
	New menus MenuFvwmScreenSaver, MenuFvwmFvwmConfiguration,
	MenuFvwmXConfiguration, MenuFvwmHelp (with a sub menu
	MenuFvwmFvwmManPage), MenuFvwmWindowMove, MenuFvwmWindowClassOps, 
	MenuFvwmWindowPickClassOps, MenuFvwmPickWindowStyle.
	Added StaysOnTop, StaysPut, StaysOnBottom to the MenuFvwmWindowStyle
	menu (need to add the Func: FuncFvwmStyleAndRecapture)
	Replace some window-shade.xpm by window.xpm (and add window.xpm
	into images/menu)
	
	Question: Do we need to split menus in rootmenus, winopsmenus,
 	utilitiesmenu ?
	Where we put the "user programs", in utilitiesmenu ?
	
	* themes/default/modules/main:
	* themes/redmond98/modules/*:
	* themes/olicha/modules/modulesauto:
	* themes/wm-icons/modules/main:
	* themes/default/menu:
	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	Added modules support for so called "visible" modules: Buttons,
	IconMan, IconBox, Pager, TaskBar, WinList (and Icon and Auto).
 	Details:
	- Removed most of the "read config default" in fvwm-theme-config
        - A proposal for a modules spec:
	  + Configuration of the visible modules. This config is in main
	  (e.g., default/modules/main) or the config is in others files
	  and are read by main (e.g., redmond98/main). Moreover, a module
	  config must contains is style (if it wants to be different than
	  the style defined in desktop): Title/Notitle, 
	  TitleAtTop/TitleAtBottom (if title), Layers (OnTop, OnBottom, Put),
	  eventually NoHandles, if needed Border and Handles width,
	  WindowListSkip/Hit, CirculateSkip/Hit, Sticky/Slippery,
	  maybe others if a guys want to use a special style for a
	  module we need to restore the style when switching ...
	  + Icon Grid, SlipperyIcon/StickyIcon, IconTitle/NoIconTitle and
 	   icon style Icon/NoIcon in the start func (I think that I forget
	   one or two icon style ?).
	  + Modules to (re)start
	  + Function for switching between modules theme:
	    FuncFvwmStartModulesTheme and FuncFvwmQuitModulesTheme
	  + Creation of MenuFvwmModulesTheme linked to the MenuFvwmRoot
	    via MenuFvwmModules
	  + We can have "optional" components: a module definition and 
	    starting/switching/menu stuff (without destruction) in a file with 
	    a different name and witch is read after modules/main (we need to
	    have the possibility to disable such a component):
 	    modules/olicha/modulesauto (I cannot live without this) give an 
	    example.
	  + I think that all our modules name have to be of the form
	    Fvwm* and if the name is an alias for FvwmFoo of the form Fvwm*Foo

	- Done some work in wm-icons/modules:
	Compactbuttons to main and done some works so that it respects
	the spec. Added the pager so that CompactButtons is almost a
	modules theme alone. Move the "change icons menu" into 
	MenuFvwmFvwmConfi. 
 	
	TODO:  
	- A better wm-icons (done some works for wm-icons, almost ok, 
	  need to configure at least one of the following modules: IconMan, 
	  WinList, IconMan or TaskBar and do a better config for the pager 
	  (miniicon!)).
 	- I've work on modules/default, but it will be good that some one 
	  else work on this so it is more a default (any way I start with
	  fvwm default)
	and do a better config for the pager (miniicon!)).
	- A migo, olicha, and afterstep modules/main.
	- I think it will be better if in MenuFvwm(Theme)Modules some
	of the modules (Buttons, TaskBar, Pager ...) are restarted and
	not just started. Currently impossible because of the existence of
  	multi-pager with the same name ...
	
	PROBLEMS: A lot :)
	Pager: It is natural to use two pagers, one for the current desk the
	other one for 2 or 3 or 4 desk. Unfortunately, the Pager does not
	support aliases, it use symlink.
	Solutions: 1. Do so that the pager support aliases (impossible:
	fvwm is feature freezed) 
	2. Added a symlink, but how and where ? (good solution)
	3. Present temporary solution: use the wait function or start only
	one pager !
	
	NOTE (not done !):
	In my opinion, other modules need to be configured in an other
	place:
	- Baker is a problem: may depends on desktopsize and pager config
	  Solutions: 1. putting desktopsize and baker in modules/ 
	  2. Fixing the numbers of desk (says 4) and use desk only Pager.
	  This is configurated in backer (not in modules/)
	  3. ???
	  Moreover,  we need to be able to disable backer, for a standard 
	  background or for a session or X background (see below).
	- Scroll, Identify, Form & script (default colors and font): 
	  in decoration !
	- Event (Audio): it can have its own config file: sounds and we
	  can enable it or disable it (in start ?)
	- Animate: in start, no problem for config.

	* bin/fvwm-themes-config:
	Do so that fvwm-theme-config do not look at file with a ".", "~"
 	and "#" in its name. # and ~ is for (x)emacs (may be we have to
	add other character). A point is for other editor (gvim) but in
	fact like that we can:
 	 - save a file: button --> buttons.orig
 	 - Or a sub main file can read files with a ".extension" in its 
	   directory (e.g., themes/redmond98/modules/main)
        and fvwm-themes will forget these files.

	* themes/{default,fvwm-icons,wm-icons}/iconstyle
	Since IconGrid and Icon/NoIcon is in modules I have renamed
	icons to iconstyle. This file gives the definition of the
 	icons and mini-icons to be used. Also, I have moved Iconfont
	into decorations (really natural).
	Added fvwm-icons for fvwm icons distribution (need more work,
	or better provide a simple and good set of icons with fvwm-themes,
	which is wm-icons compatible)
	Some works in wm-icons/iconstyle (MenuFvwmFvwmConfiguration is used
	in the place of WindowOps)
	
	* themes/default/background:
	* themes/redmond98/background:
	* themes/olicha/background:
	* themes/migo/background:
	Added backgrounds. Problem: we need to be able to disable background,
	for a backer or for a session or X background (see below).
        Use the "green" background for migo because I found a backgound that
	I prefer for the default (i.e., compatible with default/modules/main
	colors).
	
	* themes/default/style:
	Added:
	Style "FvwmConsole"     Slippery
	Is this a bad idea ?
	Note that the modules spec says that modules styles for "visible"
	modules may be defined in modules/ ; present style file break this
 	but this not a real problem, since modules/main is (and will be)
	read after this file. Added styles for FvwmScript
	
	* themes/default/functions:
	Added FuncFvwmDeiconifyFocusAndRaise
	Added FuncFvwmDeiconifyFocusAndWarp
	For modules
	
	* themes/default/desktop: Added GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickRaises 
	(dominik suggestion in the  fvwm-workers mailing list, it says that 
	the only reasonable focus policy is SloopyFocus or MouseFocus with the
	above option. I'm agree :o)
	Added the possibility of switching between page when moving a window.
	Edge Scroll is still disabled (a good thing for the default in my
	opinion)

	* themes/default/cursor: added "black white"

	* themes/default/binding:
	Mouse 1 on the border now move the window (for resize there are
	mouse 2 on the border or Mouse 1 on the window corner) This is fvwm
	default, ok it is not a good reason, but why we have "handles" ?

	* */desktop: Added some "restore default" destroyed by switching 
	between themes. Need more works: at least for migo (?) and afterstep
	(for afterstep I have copied the redmond98 one).
	Spec proposal for desktop:
	- Focus: SloppyFocus, ClickToFocus,  MouseFocus styles and global
	options: ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick / ClickToFocusPassesClick, 
	ClickToFocusDoesntRaise   /  ClickToFocusRaises,  
	MouseFocusClickDoesntRaise /  MouseFocusClickRaises
	- EdgeScroll, EdgeResistance,  EdgeThickness
	- Windows placement: smart/dumb, random/active, UsePPosition/NoPPostion
	GrabFocus/GrabFocusOff styles and SmartPlacementIsNormal/
	SmartPlacementIsReallySmart global opts.
	- Moving & Resize: ResizeOutline/ResizeOpaque style, OpaqueMoveSize,
	MoveSmoothness, HideGeometryWindow, SnapAttraction, Emulate
	- WindowShadeAnimate
	Note: all the above can be controlled by ScriptFvwmBaseConfig
	- Desktop size ???
	- ColormapFocus	FollowsMouse/FollowsFocus
	- Style * MWMFunctions, HintOverride, MWMDecor, OLDecor (is it
	reasonable to not use this ?)
	- Transient Windows styles
	- ClickTime and MoveThreshold 
	- XORValue or XORPixmap
	- SetAnimation
	- SaveUnder / SaveUnderOff style ??? (for slow server)
	- Some BugsOption: ModalityIsEvil, FlickeringMoveWorkaround(??)
	- BusyCursor ??
	Do I forget some thing ?
	I will do ScriptFvwmMiscBaseConfig when this spec will be fixed ...

	* */themes/xxx_disable_xxx: experimental theme for disabling some
	themes components (background, iconstyle)


	BIG PROBLEMS: It seems that fvwm-themes shows that there are
	some memory problems in fvwm (in particular in menus):
	a switch between themes (or reloading it) add more or less than 100K 
	of memory to fvwm ! After a numbers of switch the switching is
	slow ... for modules (pb with swallowing apps)
	It seems that we also need to unload the bindings and that
	we need to unload the non default styles ... 
	We need to be very careful with memory !
	Moreover, I've got a number of core dump ... 2.3.13 is alpha-beta
	at the present time ...

	TODO (IMHO): A lot of things. Some examples:
	- Be able to load individual component (already done I imagine)
	- Be able to unload some component.
	- Use FvwmTheme !
	- Put the stuff in cvs
	- Do not add to many themes !!
	For the future:
	- GUI interfaces
	- Split the installation site/users
	- Put all the images in a site directory
	- A perl script that build a user program menu.
	- During a user installation we need to ask questions to the
	user: e.g., what is your preferd term, editor, ... do you use
	kde/gnome menus ...etc. So that the components (e.g., buttons that
	start apps, Audio ..etc) can be builded so that the user like it
	immediatly. I think this point is important if you want that a
	lot of new linux users switch to fvwm.
 	- Add a lot of themes: maybe a fvwm-themes-contrib dist.
	
	BUGS: - redmond98/decorations config is uncompatible with the pager
	config of wm-icons/modules/main and default/modules/main and also
	with the IconTitle colors: the reason is that the real hilight color
	is given by a titlestyle command (so that the border of a window
	with the focus has the color of a normal window ... BorderStyle solid
	color doesn't work ...). Conversely, the pager of the FvwmBarButtons
	of redmond98 have the wrong color with the other decorations.
	Maybe FvwmTheme will allows to solve this.
	- If you use fvwm-icons/iconstyle with wm-icons/modules/main then
	we need to add wm-icons path to fvwm-icons path so wm-icons path
	is added two times if all its component are used.
	- I've not done the .xml files
	- a lot of other bugs ... hope that every things that can be destroyed
	is really destroyed (see the BIG PROBLEMS, here I forget bindings and
	apps styles).
	- Modules switching is not session award. Need to implement
	FuncFvwmSessionStart/QuitModulesTheme.
	
	CONCLUSION: I've done some works, but perhaps some of my ideas
	are not good. However, I think that the modules and desktop
	spec are really reasonable.
	
	Sorry for all the bad English !!
