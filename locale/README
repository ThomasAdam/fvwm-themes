Here some instructions for the files under the LANG directory.

1. The ".txt" Files:
--------------------

These files are almost txt files but are not. They look likes more
elementary sgml file and there are formatted (currently by 
fvwm-themes-script) before there are displayed to the users.

Formating Instruction: the formating instructions must (really) begin
the lines. For one which are of the form <inst> ... </inst> they must
be alone on the line, the others concern only the line where they occur.  

 <title>A title

	this will put "A title" in the center of the page and add some
	'-' under it. Then start a new line.

 <abstract>
 txt
 </abstract>

	this do nothing, the line with <abstract> and </abstract> are
	ignored, that's all :o)

 <sec>A title

	this will put "A title" on the left and add some  '-' under it
	and then start a new line.
	

 <verb>
 txt
 </verb>

	Display the "txt" exactly as it is and then start a new line

 blanc line

	the blanc lines are taken in count they are equivalent to
	a "new line". So to get a blanc line you need two blanc lines
	(one line is  enough after or before a title, sec or verb 
	environment).

 # 
	any line which begin with a # is ignored


2. The .msg file
----------------

We work on this ... even on the name ".msg" ...
