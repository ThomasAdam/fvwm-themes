To actually select a color, you should use the 4th color pallete. 
The first three 
palletes modify this forth one.

          
By
choosing a color in the first pallete, 
you
populate this color in the forth one
using black-color-white gradient.         

                                          
By choosing a 
color in 
the second 
or third
palletes,
the 4th is changed to a gradient
from this color to the selected color.    

                                          
Moreover, clicking to the selected color  has the same effect as choosing a color using the first pallete.                  

                                          
Finally, you can modify the Red Green and 
Blue values of the selected color with the
mini scroll bars.
