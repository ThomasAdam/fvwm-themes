<h3>1. Themes Selector</h3>

<p>There is a list of all found themes at the top left. When you select one
of these themes the list of the components of this theme are displayed at
the top right. Then, you can either select all components of this theme
using the left <em>Set</em> button, only the look components using the
button <em>Look</em>, or you can select only one component by selecting a
component in the top right list and using the right <em>Set</em> button. You
can get information on the theme by using the <em>README</em> button (other
buttons are not yet implemented).


<p>Your currently used configuration and all changes you are doing using the
Themes Selector are reflected in the bottom text list. The first column
lists all components, the second column displays the theme, of which the
component is used, and the third column (empty on the start) displays the
new set theme for this component if different from the currently used one
(setting a new component is done using the method explained in the paragraph
above). Finally, the last column may contain <em>Var</em>, <em>Opt</em> or
<em>V/O</em>, which indicates that the component of the theme (the used one
or the set one) has variants or options.


<p>If a component has variants or options you can modify them by selecting
the component (in the bottom list) and clicking the <em>Properties</em>
button. Moreover, you can restore the used theme of the component (unset
your component theme change) using the <em>Restore</em> button, and you can
lock the component (so that "load all" for a theme will ignore this
component) using the <em>Lock</em> button. The <em>Drop</em> button is not
yet implemented.


<p>Now to apply your changes, you have to use the <em>Apply</em> button at
the bottom. The <em>Refresh</em> button is similar to the <em>Apply</em> in
that the entire current configuration is reloaded, but your changes are not
applied. The <em>Update</em> button just rebuilds the lists used in the the
Themes Selector configuration; this is useful if you made changes in
components using other tools, like as the <em>Theme Management</em> menu or
using <em>fvwm-themes-config</em> from a command line.


<h3>2. General Settings</h3>

<p>The <em>General Settings</em> tool enables to do the same job that with
the <em>Theme Management -> current -> settings -></em> sub-menu or
equivalent form-based and gtk-based ThemeSettings samples. The top field
list represents your used and set configuration. To modify a setting, select
one component and then a field list will appear below so that you can choose
another variant for this component. All buttons at the bottom work like in
the <em>Themes Selector</em> tool screen.


<p>Important Note: Clicking on the <em>Apply</em> applies changes in both
<em>Themes Selector</em> and <em>General Settings</em> tool screens.


<h3>3. FVWM Themes Sessions</h3>

<p>FVWM Themes has its own session concept. See the fvwm-themes-start manual
page and the FAQ for details on this. This is useful to run different FVWM
Themes configurations. The GUI seems really intuitive (there is already a
mini doc in it), so we will not go further.


<p>However, here are some tips showing how sessions can be useful. If you
want to make a fast test without forgetting your current configuration, add
a session named <em>test</em> (or reuse the existing <em>test</em> session),
and define your current (usually <em>main</em>) session configuration for
it. After defining <em>test</em> session as described, click on <em>Apply</em>.
Now, you can use the <em>Themes Selector</em> and the <em>General
Settings</em> tools freely without modifying your main configuration. You
can always return to your <em>main</em> session, restoring the previous
configuration, or, if you prefer, you can update your <em>main</em>
configuration from the current <em>test</em> configuration using the same
method as described above.


<h3>4. Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>The Script has a few options, it is run as follows from the <em>Themes
Management</em> menu:

<blockquote>
  FvwmScript FvwmScript-ThemesCenter
    --text-colorset 36 --viewer-colorset 33
</blockquote>

<p>I.e., colorset 36 is used for the field list or text area and colorset 33
is used for a help line (and in addition any FvwmScript sample uses colorset
35 for its main colors). The only other option is --lang xx, where xx is the
first 2 letters of the unix LANG, like "ru_RU.koi8r". By default, the LANG
is set to the environment variable $LANG or "en". The currently supported
lang values are en, fr and ru.
