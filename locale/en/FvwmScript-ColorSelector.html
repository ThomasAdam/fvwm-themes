<div id="abstract">
<p>To actually select a color, you should use the 4th color palette.
The first three palettes modify this forth one.
</div>

<p>By choosing a color in the first palette, you populate this color in the
forth one using black-color-white gradient.

<p>By choosing a color in the second or third palettes, the 4th is changed
to a gradient from this color to the selected color.

<p>Moreover, clicking on the selected color  has the same effect as choosing
a color using the first palette.

<p>Finally, you can modify the Red, Green and Blue values of the selected
color with the mini scroll bars.
