<sec>1. Themes Selector

In the top left you have the list of all the themes. When you select one
of these themes the list of the components of this theme are displayed in
the the top right. Then, you can either select all the components of this
theme using the left "Set" button, only the look components with the button
"Look" or you can select only one component by selecting one in the top
right text field and using the left "Set" button. You can get information
on the theme by using the "README" button (the other button are not yet
implemented).


Your used configuration and the change you are doing using the Themes
Selector is reflected in the bottom text field. The first colon list
all the components, the second colon says which theme is used for the
component and the third colon (empty when you start the Script) say
which theme has been set for the component (via the method explained
in the above paragraph). Finally, the last colon may contains a "Var"
or an "Opt" which indicate that the component of the theme (the used
one or the set one if you have set this component) have some variants
or some options. 


If a component has some variants
or some options you can modify its by selecting the component (in the bottom
text field) and by using the "Property" button. Moreover, you can restore
the used component by using the "Restore" buttons and you can lock it
(i.e., a "load all" for a theme will ignore this component) by using
the "Lock" button. The "Drop" button is not yet implemented.


Now so that your change apply, you just have to use the "Apply" button
on the bottom. The refresh button will reload the current configuration
without applying the changes. The "Update" button will just update the
the Themes Selector configuration (this is useful if you have made change
using an other tool as the Theme Management menu).


<sec>2. General Settings

With this you can do the same job that with the
"Theme Management -> current -> settings ->" sub-menu. The top text field
represent your used and set configuration. To modify a setting, select
one component and then a text field will appear so that you can modify
the setting of this component. All the buttons work as for the Themes
Selector.


Important Note: If you click on "Apply" in the Themes Selector or here
the changes will be applied for both.


<sec>3. FVWM Themes Sessions

FVWM Themes has its own session concept. See the fvwm-themes-start
manual page and the FAQ for details on this. This is useful to run
different FVWM Themes configurations. The GUI seems really intuitive
(there is already a mini doc in it), so we will not go further.


However, here are some tips showing how sessions can be useful. If you
want to make a fast test without forgetting your current configuration,
add a session named "test" (or reuse the existing "test" session),
and define your current (usually "main") session configuration for it.
After defining "test" session as described, click on "Apply". Now, you
can use the Themes Selector and the General Settings tools freely
without modifying your main configuration. You can always return to your
"main" session, restoring the previous configuration, or, if you prefer,
you can update your "main" configuration from the current "test"
configuration using the same method as described above.


<sec>4. Miscenallous

The Script has a few options, it is run as follows in the Themes Management
Menu:

<verb>
  FvwmScript FvwmScript-ThemesCenter --text-colorset 34 \
                                     --viewer-colorset 33
</verb>

I.e., colorset 34 is used for the text field and colorset 33 is
used for the text of this help (any FvwmScript use colorset 36
for its main colors). The only other option is --Lang xx where
xx is a "Unix" LANG. By default the LANG is computed from $LANG
and the only supported lang are currently en, fr and ru.
