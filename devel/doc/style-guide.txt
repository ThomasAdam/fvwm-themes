                     * Programming Style Guidelines *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Use strong indentation to show the structure of sources and documents.

* In the sources always use a real TAB for indentation. Expect TAB to be
  expanded to any number of spaces (2, 3, 4 or 8) in viewers and editors.

* In the plain text files you can use TAB's or other indentation methods.
  For example, in email messages or pod documentation, where TAB is usually
  always expanded to 8, you can use two spaces instead of TAB. In this case
  don't mix spaces and TAB's; use only one for indentation in any block.

* In the ASCII art files without any text structure you should not use
  TAB's, of course, since this may break your nice diagrams.

* TAB's should only be on the left side of the line, never in the middle.
  The only exception is for commented out code, the comment sign may
  precede TAB's.

* When TAB is used (in the sources) never try to line up two lines in
  different indentation levels, it makes no sense. If you want to add
  multi-line comments on the right, put them on lines by themselves.

	$a = [ 	               # never try
	       	"value",       # to line up
	     ];	               # like this

	# put multi-line
	# comments here
	$a = [
		"value",
	];

  Lining up two lines in the same indentation levels is ok.

	$size  = 12;  # this is a one line comment
	$limit = 25;  # it's ok

* Here is an advice of using space before and after punctuation marks.

  Types of punctuation:
    * braces as indexes of $hash{"key"}, $array[1] or function(2)
      parameters: no spaces needed.
    * braces anywhere else: 2 pairs of surrounding spaces or newlines.
    * comma-like (, : ; ? "dot in english"): trailing space required.
    * minus-like (- + = . "other dual-operators"): 2 surrounding spaces.

* Usually there is no need for more than one consecutive space, except
  for a side comment (2 spaces separate a comment better).

* Try to fit your paragraph and code lines to 74-78 characters per line
  to be more readable. You can use an editor's wrap (but preserve TAB's).

* Identifier names should satisfy Java naming convention, like in
  $myVar = MyClass->myMethod($MY_CONSTANT);

* Use the style of indenting and placing curly brackets demonstrated in
  the following Perl code examples (applies to Java and C as well):

	$persons[0] = {
		name => "Ann",
		age => 21,
		marks => {
			subj1 => 4,
			subj2 => 5,
		},
	};

	if (defined($property)) {
		# modifier versus accessor
		if (@params) {
			$self->setModified();
			return $property->set(@params);
		} else {
			return $property->get();
		}
	}

* Consider any program warning to be an error, use strict;, always run with
  "perl -w" switch, try to check everything which theoretically may fail.

* Try to keep short functions/methods that perform their job very well.
  It is suggested to read Tom's object-oriented tutorial (man perltoot).

* Spell check your english if possible. In unix there is 'ispell' utility,
  which can be used by itself or within text editors.

* Use the same (lower or UPPER) case in SGML-like language (HTML, XML, XSL)
  tags and modifiers. XML is case sensitive and has <lower> standard tags.

* If you create many similar files, use the same naming scheme if possible.
  For scripts try to use thisScheme.pl, but this_scheme.txt, this-scheme.c
  or ThisScheme.html may also be used if you find this useful.

* Feel free to improvise on these rules, but at least keep in mind why
  they were created - to make life of coders reading, editing, merging and
  understanding your files easier.
