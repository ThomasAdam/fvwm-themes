Here is an information regarding fvwm-themes project on SourceForge.
This information is valid for other projects as well.

Web Services
------------

The development page is at https://sourceforge.net/projects/fvwm-themes/ .

Shell account
-------------

If you are a fvwm-themes developer, you should have an account at
shell1.sourceforge.net. Use ssh1 to connect. ssh2 on top of ssh1 is optional.
You should be a member of fvwm-themes unix group on this and other machines.
You can use scp1 to upload files into sourceforge:
  scp1 my-local-file login@shell1.sourceforge.net:/my/remote/dir

Unfortunately when scp1 is used, the files are uploaded with bad permissions,
you should correct them manually, see the section "Creating new files" below.

Home Page
---------

The URL is: http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/ .
It is located in /home/groups/fvwm-themes/htdocs/ on shell1.

Public FTP
----------

The URL is: ftp://projects.sourceforge.net/pub/fvwm-themes/ .
It is located in /home/groups/ftp/pub/fvwm-themes/ on shell1.

File Releases
-------------

The URL is: http://download.sourceforge.net/fvwm-themes/?M=D .
With counts: https://sourceforge.net/project/filelist.php?group_id=1738 .

Creating new files
------------------

When you create new files in Home Page or Public FTP, make sure all files
have group fvwm-themes and mode g+w, i.e. if needed execute:
  chgrp fvwm-themes file
  chmod 664 file  # 2775 for directories and executables

If you put 'umask 2' command in your ~/.profile (bash) or ~/.login (tcsh)
the second command (chmod 664 file) will not be needed. Also it is usually
enough (if your umask is 2) to setup the main directory with mode 2775 and
give it a group fvwm-themes, and all new files and subdirectories in it will
be with correct permissions automatically.

Compile Farm
------------

There are several machines on SourcForge with different linux distributions
and FreeBSD: linux.compile.sourceforge.net & bsd.compile.sourceforge.net.
You can test building, installing and running fvwm-themes on them, like:
  make --prefix ../test-prefix install
  ../test-prefix/bin/fvwm-themes-config --fresh

CVS
---

Read instructions on https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=1738 and
http://fvwm.org/cvs.html to learn how to use cvs.

Every change should be documented in ChangeLog.
When you commit, always use a one line (or several lines) log, i.e.:
  cvs -m 'updated X; added Y' commit
  cvs -F file.log commit

Good luck!
