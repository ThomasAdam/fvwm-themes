This theme tries to mimic nanoGUI (is it micro microGUI?).
Based on a configuration contributed by Kristian Peters <kristian@korseby.net>.

There is a unique titlebar button selector, i.e. you may choose from many
predefined titlebar button sets.

This theme currently uses colors-extra component, which is not common.
To drop it you should explicitely go to "current -> colors-extra -> Drop".
