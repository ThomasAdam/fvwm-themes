Multichoice theme is provided for both demonstrative and functional reasons.
It includes highly configurable components with several choices each.

background - this component has more than 20 background choices,
from gradient-based to image-based.

buttons - this component includes many titlebar button faces, from
vector-based to image-based; you may also choose which window buttons
are used and their order.

cursors - this component has several cursor sets to choose from, including
shape and color variations.

fonts - this component may help if you want to use international charsets,
which are not normally chosen on your system by default.
