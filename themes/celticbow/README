Celtic-Bow (2) theme by Kathryn Andersen
====================================

This is basically the PlainBow theme with Celtic buttons.
The buttons were based on (but not the same as) the Celtic buttons
in Dorothy's celtic themes at <http://www.twobarleycorns.net/fvwm-decors.html>

background
	A delicate lace pattern of my own design, hued to match
	the theme. (requires ImageMagic)

buttons
	5 buttons: menu (knot), maximize (up arrow), sticky (left arrow)
	on the left, and iconize (down arrow), kill (swirly X) on the right.
	The active buttons have a 3D look, the inactive ones are flat.

colors
	There are two main sets of colours, default, and active, plus a
	little bit of highlight colours (like used in the Pager
	highlighting).  This means there is a lot more unity of look
	than in the default colors, since a fair few of the Colorsets
	are identical.
	This sets the titlebars to a vertical gradient, so it looks curved.
	This also sets the menus to a diagonal blend gradient between
	the "active" colours and the "default" colours.

windowlook
	This windowlook is basically flat, except when buttons are
	pressed in.
