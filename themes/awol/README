The theme by Alex Wallis. (awol@dove.net.au)
 
This is close the the config I used for many years
with early versions of fvwm2 and fvwm95.
The button bars are continually being updated.

I normally use the Dali & kLo buttons.
xdaliclock is pretty kewl, and the kLo_mixer is the
best little slide control for different sound card
settings that I've found. I forget where I found it.
And I don't have the source anymore, but I'll send
a copy of my binary if anyone's interested.

My sounds are kinda noisy at the moment, I plan to
add different soundscapes to this theme.
