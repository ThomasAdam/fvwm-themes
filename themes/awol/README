The theme by Alex Wallis. (awol@prepaidonline.com.au)
 
This is close the the config I used for many years
with earlier versions of fvwm and fvwm95.
The button bars are continually evolving.

Since I moved to redhat I haven't been able to 
get kLo_mix to work, so I switched to XtMix 
which is a KDE applet that FvwmButtons is only 
too happy to swallow. A right click brings
up a mixer panel. You can get rpm's of XtMix from
http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~mdenn/xtmix/xtmix_en.html

I've added a few new icons and routines, and
basically "prettied" it up to suit my new
xineramic dual head display! For example a left
click on the first icon brings up a menu and you 
can change both the icon and the menu with a right 
click. I stole the logo's I'm using from my redhat 
system, so I hope they're ok to use. I may add more 
of them later, with more elaborate routines.

Please send any comments or queries about this theme,
or on any other topic of interest to

Enjoy!
Alex
