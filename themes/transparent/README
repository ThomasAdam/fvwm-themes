This theme tries to make everything more or less transparent. :)

Important note!  Your background should be loaded using "fvwm-root -r",
"Esetroot", "wmsetbg" or similar utilities.  Or just "fvwm-themes-root".

If you only use PNG or XPM background images then you don't need to install
anything for this theme to work (most of backgrounds included in fvwm-themes
are loaded using "fvwm-themes-root" utility, it automatically uses
"fvwm-root -r" when possible).

If you use JPG, TIF or GIF background images, then you should install
either "wmsetbg" or "Esetroot".  Then use "fvwm-themes-root" to load
your background as usual, it will autodetect the actual image loader.
