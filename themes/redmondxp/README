This theme mimics a look of Microsoft Windows XP.
Created by Mikhael Goikhman, tweaked by Shawn Anderson.

One of the central features is a configurable panel. It is managed
using FvwmThemesPanelManager (an fvwm module written in Perl) that
loads/stores the user preferences for numerous settings and maintains
the clock. If you don't see the time and date in the panel, this means
you have problems with this Perl-based module, see X error messages.

The panel takes the currently used theme colors, this is done using
png images with alpha blending. So modules@redmondxp component works
fine with colors@ of any other theme.

Several images are from Lunatic Sawfish theme (by Stefan Zeiger).
Several other images are constructed from screenshots on the web.
The background image is taken from the early XPDE project.

For a better emulation, install fonts from corefonts.sf.net, they
should be auto-detected and used.
