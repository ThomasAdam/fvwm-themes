This theme mimics a look of Microsoft Windows XP.
Created by Mikhael Goikhman.

Several images are from Lunatic SawFish theme (by Stefan Zeiger).
Several other images are constructed from screenshots on the web.
The background image is an original work, reuse it freely.

For a better emulation install fonts from corefonts.sf.net, they
will be auto-detected and used.
