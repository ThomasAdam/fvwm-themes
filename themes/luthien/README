This is the configuration used by the main FVWM developer Dominik Vogt.
Adapted for fvwm-themes by Mikhael Goikhman.

The full original configuration can be found at:
  ftp://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/pub/fvwm-themes/samples/domivogt/

There are several gradient color palettes for your choice in this theme.
The modules use a transparent colorset, this enables IconMan, Pager,
xload, xclock and xosview, all to be drawn on FvwmButtons transparently.
