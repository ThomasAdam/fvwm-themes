This theme is close to my main fvwm configuration used for months.

It does not include modules; the modules, which I use are in wm-icons theme,
but I am thinking about moving these modules to this theme, since now
fvwm-themes is wm-icons compatible anyway.

He! Mikhael, the modules are know included (olicha).

Mikhael Goikhman.
