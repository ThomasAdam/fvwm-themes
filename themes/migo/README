This theme is close to my main fvwm configuration used for months.

I find a pager at the left-top and FvwmButtons-Compact at the right-top
to be very useful, it is my favorite module feel. Since my wife, on her
machine, likes the pager to be together with other buttons at the
right-top, and also likes to combine xload and clock (xloadtime),
I have added different options to the pager and the button bar.

I find the included globalfeel one of the best feels for FVWM (my personal
opinion). For example, I don't like a window to be auto raised, especially
when I click into it just to copy from or paste to it. For explicit raise
I use Alt-Mouse2 inside a window or clicking on window borders or title.

I usually use a full GNOME panel at the bottom of the screen, but one
can choose FvwmTaskBar, FvwmIconMan or nothing at all at the bottom.

The button bar is wm-icons compatible, it uses icon set 'bar', so,
in case you have wm-icons package installed, you can point it using a menu
to any other existing icon set, not only to the default 16x16-kde.
The change in 'bar' icon set is done dynamically, no need to restart fvwm.
