This theme tries to mimic BrushedMetal look from different window managers.
Based on a configuration contributed by Kristian Peters <kristian@korseby.net>.

This theme currently uses colors-extra component, which is not common.
To drop it you should explicitely go to "current -> colors-extra -> Drop".
