Notes.

This theme is meant to mimic mainly the look and some of the feel
of the 'Outcomes' theme for the Blackbox window manager written
by Brad Hughes et al. It copies the title bar and window buttons
look, and also includes a Blackbox-like toolbar.

For the toolbar to work, you need to install xdaliclock, which is
(another) clock program. (I'm still looking for a more simple
digital clock, does anybody know a good link?) Get it from
freshmeat, or from the link included below. Also, the theme
requires one of the later snapshots of fvwm2.3.13, get this from
the Fvwm homepage.

[By Mikhael: xdaliclock is now not needed, FvwmApplet-DigitalClock used.]

The theme was produced by a Gimp-Perl script on which I'm
currently working. The script parses Blackbox setup files, and
produces fvwm2 setup files and pixmaps, that will mimic the
Blackbox theme. I'll include the link to a preliminary version of
the script below. In addition (not included in the fvwm-themes
distribution), the script also produces setups for several
different toolbar widths, and some pixmaps that will mimic the
neXt look (experimental).

Have fun,

Jos.
