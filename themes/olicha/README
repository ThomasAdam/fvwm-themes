As the default, but the root one a black/yellow hand

* Modules:
---------

The FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets is a Button Bar for WMaker and AfterStep applets.
You may edit modules/main:FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets to choose your prefered
applets. Also it is not started by default, you may edit modules/main
if you want it by default. The more compatible FvwmButtons-FvwmApplets is
started by default.
How to use these Buttons: Mouse 1 in the backgroud of a button will start 
a panel if it is not started, will ummap it if it is visibale and map it
if it started but not visible. Mouse 3 in the backgroud of a button will 
kill.
