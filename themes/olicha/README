The theme is created by Olivier Chapuis on 15/Jan/2000.

* Background:
------------

It is from KDE background collection: blue freon.

* Windows Buttons:
-----------------

Mac styles Buttons from ... I do not remember. 
As usual you can ask the buttons themselves about their info by clicking
Ctrl-Alt + title button.

* Cursor:
--------

As the default, but the root one a black/yellow hand

* Modules:
---------

The FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets is a Button Bar for WMaker and AfterStep applets.
You may edit modules/main:FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets to choose your prefered
applets. Also it is not started by default. The more compatible 
FvwmButtons-FvwmApplets is started by default.
How to use these Buttons: Mouse 1 in the backgroud of a button will start 
a panel if it is not started, will ummap it if it is visibale and map it
if it started but not visible. Mouse 3 in the backgroud of a button will 
kill.
