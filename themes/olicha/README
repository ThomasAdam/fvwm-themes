The theme is created by Olivier Chapuis on 15/Jan/2000.

* Background:
------------

It is from the KDE background collection: blue freon.

* Windows Buttons:
-----------------

Mac style Buttons from ... I do not remember. 
As usual, you can ask the buttons themselves about their bindings by
clicking Ctrl-Alt + title button.

* Cursor:
--------

As the default, but the root one a black/yellow hand

* Modules:
---------

The FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets is a Button Bar for WMaker and AfterStep applets.
You may edit modules/FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets to choose your prefered
applets (see below). Also this Button Bar is not started by default.
The more compatible FvwmButtons-FvwmApplets is started by default
(use current->modules->Applets in the Theme Management menu to change).

How to use these Buttons: Mouse 1 on the button background starts a panel
if it is not started, ummaps it if it is visibale and maps it if it is
started but not visible. Mouse 3 on the button background kills.

* How to overwrite modules/FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets
---------------------------------------------------------

If it is not already done, create your personal theme directory:

  mkdir $FVWM_USERDIR/themes/personal

Copy the contents of

  fvwm-themes-install-dir/themes/olicha/modules/FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets

to the file modules-extra in the personal theme directory and then
choose your preferred applets (with help of indicators in this file).

The instructions above apply to modules components in other themes as well,
the only problem is that if a module in an other theme have the same name,
its configuration will be also over-written. However, for
FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets and others this is not a problem.

Now, the above is enough if you use modules@olicha. But, if for some strange
reason you want to be able to use this module with modules from other themes,
you should add the following to modules-extra (be ware that the position of
WMakerApplets may  conflict with modules from different (from olicha) themes;
say, if you use modules@default and icons, the first icon will be overlapped).

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# the following is only needed as an addition to the contents of 
# modules/FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets if you always want to have
# FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets in your menus regardless of the current theme.

Style "FvwmButtons-WMaker*Applets" NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0, Sticky, \
	WindowListSkip, CirculateHit, NoIcon, TitleAtTop

# Uncomment this to start WMakerApplets unconditionally (not suggested).
# In this case you should disable any button bar in modules@olicha, of course.
#AddToFunc   FuncFvwmStartThemeModules
#+ I FvwmButtons FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets

# Any way we always want it in the modules menu
AddToMenu   MenuFvwmStartThemeModules "&My WMaker Applets" \
	FuncFvwmRestartMyWMApplets FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets
AddToMenu   MenuFvwmStopThemeModules "Stop &My WMaker Applets"  \
	FuncFvwmStopWMakerButtons

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMyPopupPanel
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMyPopupPanel
+ "I" All  ($0 CirculateHit) Iconify
+ "I" None ($0 CirculateHit) FvwmButtons -g +$1+$2 $0

# Function to stop WMakerButtons
DestroyFunc FuncFvwmStopWMakerButtons
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmStopWMakerButtons
+ I FuncFvwmStopModuleByAlias FvwmButtons FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets
+ I FuncFvwmStopModuleByAlias FvwmButtons FvwmButtons-WMakerClockApplets
+ I FuncFvwmStopModuleByAlias FvwmButtons FvwmButtons-WMakerCpuApplets
+ I FuncFvwmStopModuleByAlias FvwmButtons FvwmButtons-WMakerCdApplets
+ I FuncFvwmStopModuleByAlias FvwmButtons FvwmButtons-WMakerMoreApplets

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmRestartMyWMApplets
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmRestartMyWMApplets
+ I FuncFvwmStopWMakerButtons
+ I FvwmButtons $0

AddToFunc   FuncFvwmStopThemeModules
+ I FuncFvwmStopWMakerButtons
+ I DestroyStyle "FvwmButtons-WMaker*Applets"
# Clean up all, not really needed, since modules-extra is loaded every time.
+ I DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons-WMaker*Applets*
+ I DestroyFunc FuncFvwmStopWMakerButtons
+ I DestroyFunc FuncFvwmRestartMyWMApplets
+ I DestroyStyle "FvwmButtons-WMaker*Applets"
+ I DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMyPopupPanel

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that, again, the method above may apply to others modules in other
themes, but you should know what you are doing.
