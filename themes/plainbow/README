PlainBow theme by Kathryn Andersen
==================================

This theme is a reconstruction of my own personal desktop look-and-feel
(converted from my old traditional Fvwm2 setup)
The reason it's called PlainBow is a pun on rainbow, because I use
my "rainbow" script to create the colours, but it's a pretty plain
sleek sort of look.  It's also meant to match my PlainBow GTK theme,
which is also processed by my rainbow script.

background
	Very plain, in the same colours as the theme.

buttons
	5 buttons: menu, maximize, pin(sticky) on the left, and
	iconize, kill on the right.

colors
	There are two main sets of colours, default, and active, plus a
	little bit of highlight colours (like used in the Pager
	highlighting).  This means there is a lot more unity of look
	than in the default colors, since a fair few of the Colorsets
	are identical.
	This also sets the titlebars to a vertical gradient, so it looks
	curved.

globalfeel
	The main difference between this and the default globalfeel
	is that it uses MouseFocus rather than SloppyFocus.  SloppyFocus
	drives me nuts.

menustyle
	The main difference between this and the default menustyle
	is that I've changed the font.

modules
	I copied these from default, and then altered FvwmButtons so
	that it contains a pager and an icon manager and that's all.
	(Since I normally use gkrellm, I don't need xbiff or xload
	or xclock swallowed apps).
	Also I prefer an 4x2 desk to a 3x3 one.

windowlook
	This windowlook looks rather strange without the colors,
	because the VGradient in the colors makes the Flat titlebar
	look curved, wheras with a solid colour the titlebar
	looks inset.  But with the colors, I think it looks rather cool,
	the way the active buttons pop out and the inactive buttons
	blend into the background.
