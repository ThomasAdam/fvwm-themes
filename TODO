                      Things to do before 0.4.0
                      -------------------------


Important items to do:
---------------------

* colors@ components. Check if every things is ok with the new colors
files.

* settings@default: think which subcomponents to remove/move.
  Move settings/stroke@ to bindings@ option.

* Think where belong all functions sitting in different components.
  Probably rename functions-appbind to functions-user. [migo]

* Write some documentation about CCDS. [migo]

* Fix all crashes.

Optional items to do:
--------------------

* Add a special variable $. in fvwm for specifying relative paths. [migo]

* desktop@, we may leave this for now as is, but in the future it should
  be more formalized.

* Providing some ready to use functions for background@ components.
  Like functions dealing with image types and formats (tiles, gradients).

* A form/script/gtk for FvwmRearrange.

* It would be nice if someone enhance 'multichoice' theme.
  I.e. add some color schemes, backgrounds and cursors (bitmap cursors?).
  If noone does this, this theme can probably be removed.

* A better web page. Does someone want to help on this?

* Better integration of fvwm-themes-xres.

* Creating fvwm-themes-gtk. Jos?

* Creating fvwm-themes-qt. Someone?

* CCDS (component configuration & dependancy system, a better name?).
  It may be surprizing, but I think that we don't really need to implement
  something more than we have now before 0.4, It is difficult and time
  consuming (see my another message). Hovewer we should think about
  dependency types and syntax improvements in .cfg which we may need in
  the future. The idea here is that a user should be able to create a
  normal theme (no options) by providing only components, without .cfg.

* Completing 'cde' theme. need a windowlook and a modules theme [olivier, jos]

* Fix button@spruce: can we do these buttons with vectors? The problems
  is that they have fixed colors.

Problems without obvious soluton:
--------------------------------

* Rereading iconstyles/style-icon-miniicon file dynamically is not enough
  if someone (me) have icon style extentions. Should be solved using
  dependances somehow (using 'extends').

Closed (will be deleted after 0.4.0):
------------------------------------

* modules@ components. Several things may be improved.
