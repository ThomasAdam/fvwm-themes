                      Things to do before 0.4.0
                      -------------------------


Important items to do:
---------------------

* CCDS (component configuration & dependancy system, a better name?).
  It may be surprizing, but I think that we don't really need to implement
  something more than we have now before 0.4, It is difficult and time
  consuming (see my another message). Hovewer we should think about
  dependency types and syntax improvements in .cfg which we may need in
  the future. The idea here is that a user should be able to create a
  normal theme (no options) by providing only components, without .cfg.

* colors@ components. We should improve colorset list, probably add some
  items and move others. Application bar modules have only 3 colorsets, it
  is inacceptable, there should be 4-6. [Olivier]

* fix problem with FvwmTheme: sometimes the colors of the swallowed window
of the Buttons are not the good one. May be we can restart FvwmTheme in
colors as before. Mikhael any objections? - Yes, any. :)
I think I fixed this, DestroyModuleConfig FvwmTheme* was commented in.
If not, how can I reproduce this?

* modules@ components. Several things may be improved.

* settings@default: think which subcomponents to remove/move.
  Move settings/stroke@ to bindings@ option.

* to think where belong all functions sitting in different components.
  Probably rename functions-appbind to functions-user.

* completing 'cde' theme. [olivier, jos]

* Do so that the session support work again (need discussion).

* Finish colors@spruce.

* Begin "FvwmScript-ThemeCenter".

* I will write some documentation about CCDS.

* of course, fixing all crashes.

Optional items to do:
--------------------

* I can add a special variable $. in fvwm for specifying relative paths.

* desktop@, we may leave this for now as is, but in the future it should
  be more formalized.

* providing some ready to use functions for background@ components.
  Like functions dealing with image types and formats (tiles, gradients).

* It would be nice if someone enhance 'multichoice' theme.
  I.e. add some color schemes, backgrounds and cursors (bitmap cursors?).
  If noone does this, this theme can probably be removed.

* a better web page. Does someone want to help on this?
  Maybe someone who didn't wrote to this list yet?

* better integration of fvwm-themes-xres

* Creating fvwm-themes-gtk. Jos?

* Creating fvwm-themes-qt. Someone?

Problems without obvious soluton:
--------------------------------

* Rereading iconstyles/style-icon-miniicon file dynamically is not enough
  if someone (me) have icon style extentions. Should be solved using
  dependances somehow (using 'extends').
