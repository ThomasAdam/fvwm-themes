                      Things to do before 1.0.0
                      -------------------------

* Localization (actual translations).
  [In progress]

* Optimizing reload commands needed for changes in components.
  [started]

* Fix a bug, when an option is removed, it is still here (due to 'current').
  The same if the option is added.

* To verify: seems like GUI loads @personal theme when not asked.

* Check fvwm-themes and fvwm with kde2.
  [In progress; need to (re?)add a FAQ entries for KDE]

* Add FuncFvwmConfirm to functions@default, which gets 2 parameters,
  a confirm string and a command to do on "Ok" as opposite to "Cancel".

* Add buttons@multichoice with titlebar button order selector (1 option)
  and button sets from default/redmond98/osx and more (variants or 1 option).
  Button set may contain iconify/maximize/close/shade/stick/options names.

Optional items to do:
--------------------

* Add fvwm-themes-component --random-change.

* Enhance vector buttons in fvwm, support @2 - bg, @3 - fg.

* Add twm theme (probably menustyle@, windowlook@, buttons@, colors@), like in
  ftp://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/pub/fvwm-themes/samples/nikke/
  We need a twm user here, maybe, nikke.

* Add theme similar to http://uop.sourceforge.net/bridge.jpg or other
  default enlightenment like. How to call it?
  The problem. I want to add only window decorations, but I should add
  entire colors@ (too big). Should colors@ be divided?

* Improve fvwm-themes-images:
  + support the X standard rgb:rr/gg/bb better then #rrggbb
  + implement sky on the transparent image color
  + enable specifying transparent border, and before applying --tile or --sky

* Think where belong all functions sitting in different components.

* Providing some ready to use functions for background@ components.
  Like functions dealing with image types and formats (tiles, gradients).

* A form/script/gtk for FvwmRearrange.

* A better web page. Does someone want to help on this?

* Better integration of fvwm-themes-xres.

* Creating fvwm-themes-gtk. Jos?

* Creating fvwm-themes-qt. Someone?

* settings@default: think which subcomponents to remove/move.

* Rewrite fvwm-themes-menuapp: use a database for building menu-user
and (mini)icons styles. These database may have the power to use
the other database about menus in the machine (kde, gnome, wmconfig,
debian sys menu, ...). Rename menu-user by menus-programs.

* Work on the menu editor. By default only edit "MenuFvwmPersonal"
because menus-programs have to be regenerated after (un)installation
of applications on the machine.

Ideas:
-----

* Component's scalar property, which unlike options, where only values
  from a range (1 .. options) are accepted, can be freely set by a user.
  Examples of scalar types: Color, String, Minutes, Milliseconds etc.
  There should be individual editors for this scalar property.

  Or alternatively, extend a functionality of option. It may have type (File,
  Color, String, Minutes, Milliseconds) for choices, which are all either
  predefined or user-defined. Every choice (that is currently called value)
  has name and value. The user-defined choice has user-value and user-defined
  keys; it may be represented in a menu as "user-value ... Change".

* background-auto@ component (with a scalar of type Minutes), which will
  iterate over a background@ options randomly or sequencially every n minutes.

* Introduce option-value/variant groups, which only affect presentation menus,
  not logic; for example it is possible to have 6 groups of variants, say,
  6 types of backgrounds. With inline=1 groups are simply delimited ("" Nop),
  with inline=0 there are 6 submenus of variants.

* Add @random theme with "virtual" components.

* Add @gtk theme, which uses FvwmGtk when possible. For example, it may
  convert menus*@default using fvwm-themes-gtk or similar.

Problems without obvious soluton:
--------------------------------

* Rereading iconstyles/style-icon-miniicon file dynamically is not enough
  if someone (me) have icon style extentions. Should be solved using
  dependances somehow (using 'extends').

Closed items (will be deleted after 1.0.0):
------------------------------------------
* Internationalization using locale/LANG/ directories.

* Improve fvwm-themes-images:
  + without args it should exit with "Try --help."
  + option names are not intuitive, probably rename some
  + support the X standard rgb:rr/gg/bb better, probably better then #rrggbb
  + use "," color delimiter, not ":"; use "/" in dec rgb color instead of ","

* Convert all hardcoded $FT_DATADIR/... paths to relative $./ .
  (not fully)

* Improve wm-icons icon sets, release 0.3.0 as soon as possible.

* Fully support a new wm-icons icon list (84 icons) in fvwm-themes.

* Fix problems on FreeBSD and Solaris.

* Test and port fvwm-themes to native BSD's and Solaris.
  There are problems for sure, mkdir without -p, no killall etc.
  [got positive feedback from users]
