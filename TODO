                      Things to do before 0.4.0
                      -------------------------


Important items to do:
---------------------

* Test and port fvwm-themes to BSD and Solaris.
  There are problems for sure, mkdir without -p, no killall etc.

Optional items to do:
--------------------

* Convert all hardcoded $FT_DATADIR/... paths to relative $./ .

* Translations.

* Fix a bug, when an option is removed, it is still here (due to 'current').
  The same if the option is added.

* Fix a problem when the current component (say used in old session) does
  not exist anymore. Probably write a warning (xmessage), not fatal error.

* Think where belong all functions sitting in different components.

Items not to do for now:
-----------------------

* Providing some ready to use functions for background@ components.
  Like functions dealing with image types and formats (tiles, gradients).

* A form/script/gtk for FvwmRearrange.

* A better web page. Does someone want to help on this?

* Better integration of fvwm-themes-xres.

* Creating fvwm-themes-gtk. Jos?

* Creating fvwm-themes-qt. Someone?

* CCDS (component configuration & dependancy system, a better name?).
  It may be surprizing, but I think that we don't really need to implement
  something more than we have now before 0.4, It is difficult and time
  consuming (see my another message). Hovewer we should think about
  dependency types and syntax improvements in .cfg which we may need in
  the future. The idea here is that a user should be able to create a
  normal theme (no options) by providing only components, without .cfg.

* colors@ components. Check if every things is ok with the new colors
  files. migo: Maybe one colorset for swallowing is not enough?
  I don't think xload's check-like can somehow be related to xclock
  darts colors, probably a separate color would be ok, also hi, sh used
  out of purpose. It is not very critical. Just a note.

* settings@default: think which subcomponents to remove/move.
  Move settings/stroke@ to bindings@ option.

Ideas:
-----

* component's scalar property, which unlike options, where only values
  from a range (1 .. options) are accepted, can be freely set by a user.
  Examples of scalar types: Color, String, Minutes, Milliseconds etc.
  There should be individual editors for this scalar property.

* background-auto@ component (with a scalar of type Minutes), which will
  iterate over a background@ options randomly or sequencially every n minutes.

* introduce option-value/variant groups, which only affect presentation menus,
  not logic; for example it is possible to have 6 groups of variants, say,
  6 types of backgrounds. With inline=1 groups are simply delimited ("" Nop),
  with inline=0 there are 6 submenus of variants.

Problems without obvious soluton:
--------------------------------

* Rereading iconstyles/style-icon-miniicon file dynamically is not enough
  if someone (me) have icon style extentions. Should be solved using
  dependances somehow (using 'extends').

Closed (will be deleted after 0.4.0):
------------------------------------

* modules@ components. Several things may be improved.

* Add luthien theme. olicha: maybe add a Desker? 
  migo: I an neutral here

* Fix all crashes.

* Fix FvwmForm-ThemeSettings (session is obsolete).

* desktop@, we may leave this for now as is, but in the future it should
  be more formalized.

* It would be nice if someone enhance 'multichoice' theme.

* Completing 'cde' theme. need a windowlook and a modules theme.

* Increase speed of fvwm-themes-config.
  Make current theme.cfg with one include line non needed.

* Revise all existing docs.

* Write some documentation about CCDS.

* Add missing info to doc/creating-themes, info about how to create themes
  from zero, what components to include, what to include in each component.
