                      Things to do before 0.4.0
                      -------------------------


Important items to do:
---------------------

* Think where belong all functions sitting in different components.
  [optional]

* Write some documentation about CCDS. [migo]

* Fix FvwmForm-ThemeSettings (session is obsolete).
[Alex; if not done before 0.4.0 comment the entries in the menu]

* Fix all crashes.

Ideas:
-----

* component's scalar property, which unlike options, where only values
  from a range (1 .. options) are accepted, can be freely set by a user.
  Examples of scalar types: Color, String, Minutes, Milliseconds etc.
  There should be individual editors for this scalar property.

* background-auto@ component (with a scalar of type Minutes), which will
  iterate over a background@ options randomly or sequencially every n minutes.

* introduce option-value/variant groups, which only affect presentation menus,
  not logic; for example it is possible to have 6 groups of variants, say,
  6 types of backgrounds. With inline=1 groups are simply delimited ("" Nop),
  with inline=0 there are 6 submenus of variants.

Optional items to do:
--------------------

* Add a special variable $. in fvwm for specifying relative paths. [migo]

* Increase speed of fvwm-themes-config.
  Make current theme.cfg with one include line non needed.

* Fix a bug, when an option is removed, it is still here (due to 'current').

* desktop@, we may leave this for now as is, but in the future it should
  be more formalized.

* Providing some ready to use functions for background@ components.
  Like functions dealing with image types and formats (tiles, gradients).

* A form/script/gtk for FvwmRearrange.

* It would be nice if someone enhance 'multichoice' theme.
  I.e. add some color schemes, backgrounds and cursors (bitmap cursors?).
  If noone does this, this theme can probably be removed.

* A better web page. Does someone want to help on this?

* Better integration of fvwm-themes-xres.

* Creating fvwm-themes-gtk. Jos?

* Creating fvwm-themes-qt. Someone?

* CCDS (component configuration & dependancy system, a better name?).
  It may be surprizing, but I think that we don't really need to implement
  something more than we have now before 0.4, It is difficult and time
  consuming (see my another message). Hovewer we should think about
  dependency types and syntax improvements in .cfg which we may need in
  the future. The idea here is that a user should be able to create a
  normal theme (no options) by providing only components, without .cfg.

* Completing 'cde' theme. need a windowlook and a modules theme [olivier, jos]

* colors@ components. Check if every things is ok with the new colors
files. migo: Maybe one colorset for swallowing is not enough?
I don't think xload's check-like can somehow be related to xclock
darts colors, probably a separate color would be ok, also hi, sh used
out of purpose. It is not very critical. Just a note.

* settings@default: think which subcomponents to remove/move.
  Move settings/stroke@ to bindings@ option.

Problems without obvious soluton:
--------------------------------

* Rereading iconstyles/style-icon-miniicon file dynamically is not enough
  if someone (me) have icon style extentions. Should be solved using
  dependances somehow (using 'extends').

Closed (will be deleted after 0.4.0):
------------------------------------

* modules@ components. Several things may be improved.

* Add luthien theme. olicha: maybe add a Desker? 
migo: do you want all themes to be the same? :)
