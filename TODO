                      Things to do before 1.0.0
                      -------------------------

* Localization (actual translations).
  [In progress]

* Optimizing reload commands needed for changes in components.
  [Needs only clean up now]

* Fix a bug, when an option is removed, it is still here (due to 'current').
  The same if the option is added.

* To verify: seems like GUI loads @personal theme when not asked.
  [olicha: never see this recently]

* Check fvwm-themes and fvwm with kde2.
  [finished but the documentation]

* Split swallow colorset to 2 colorsets. There are shading problems.

* Write a full documentation à la HOWTO

Optional items to do:
--------------------

* Add fvwm-themes-config --random-change.

* Add twm theme (probably menustyle@, windowlook@, buttons@, colors@), like in
  ftp://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/pub/fvwm-themes/samples/nikke/
  We need a twm user here, maybe, nikke.

* Add SGI theme like in http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/sgi_snap.gif .

* Improve fvwm-themes-images:
  + support the X standard rgb:rr/gg/bb better then #rrggbb
  + implement sky on the transparent image color
  + enable specifying transparent border, and before applying --tile or --sky

* Think where belong all functions sitting in different components.

* Providing some ready to use functions for background@ components.
  Like functions dealing with image types and formats (tiles, gradients).

* A form/script/gtk for FvwmRearrange.

* A better web page. Does someone want to help on this?

* Better integration of fvwm-themes-xres.

* Creating fvwm-themes-gtk. Jos?

* Creating fvwm-themes-qt. Someone?

* settings@default: think which subcomponents to remove/move.

* Rewrite fvwm-themes-menuapp: use a database for building menu-user
and (mini)icons styles. These database may have the power to use
the other database about menus in the machine (kde, gnome, wmconfig,
debian sys menu, ...). Rename menu-user by menus-programs.

* Work on the menu editor. By default only edit "MenuFvwmPersonal"
because menus-programs have to be regenerated after (un)installation
of applications on the machine.

Ideas:
-----

* Component's scalar property, which unlike options, where only values
  from a range (1 .. options) are accepted, can be freely set by a user.
  Examples of scalar types: Color, String, Minutes, Milliseconds etc.
  There should be individual editors for this scalar property.

  Or alternatively, extend a functionality of option. It may have type (File,
  Color, String, Minutes, Milliseconds) for choices, which are all either
  predefined or user-defined. Every choice (that is currently called value)
  has name and value. The user-defined choice has user-value and user-defined
  keys; it may be represented in a menu as "user-value ... Change".

* background-auto@ component (with a scalar of type Minutes), which will
  iterate over a background@ options randomly or sequencially every n minutes.

* Introduce option-value/variant groups, which only affect presentation menus,
  not logic; for example it is possible to have 6 groups of variants, say,
  6 types of backgrounds. With inline=1 groups are simply delimited ("" Nop),
  with inline=0 there are 6 submenus of variants.

* Add @random theme with "virtual" components.

* Add @gtk theme, which uses FvwmGtk when possible. For example, it may
  convert menus*@default using fvwm-themes-gtk or similar.

Problems without obvious soluton:
--------------------------------

Closed items (will be deleted after 0.7.0):
------------------------------------------
* Add theme(s) similar to some enlightenment themes.

* Rereading iconstyles/style-icon-miniicon file dynamically is not enough
  if someone (me) have icon style extentions. Should be solved using
  dependances somehow (using 'extends').
  [olicha: I think this is fixed with the iconstyles-extra component?]
  [migo: I mean, "Read style-icon-miniicon" in modules/main is not enough.]
  [Seems we have now !NoIcon to undo NoIcon, just what is needed!]
