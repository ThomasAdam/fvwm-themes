.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBfvwm-themes-start\fR
[ \fB--session\fR|\fB\-s\fR name ] [ \fB--no-start|-n\fR ] 
[ \fB--fvwm-exe|-e\fR ] [ \fB--\fR fvwm-args ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This script runs fvwm with FVWM Themes.  It should be run under X.
Put a call to this script as the last line of your .Xclients, .xinitrc
or .xsession file.

.SH "OPTIONS"
\fB--session\fR name \- name of the FVWM Themes session. By default it
is "main". This allows to have and run different FVWM Themes configuration.

\fB--no-start\fR - do not start fvwm, just do preparation for starting it.
This is useful to start FVWM Themes with a session manager, see FAQ.

\fB--fvwm-exe\fR - changes the default executable, which is \fIfvwm\fR
or whatever \fIfvwm-config --fvwm-exe\fR returns.

\fB--\fR everything after \fB--\fR is passed to FVWM.
See the \fBfvwm\fR(1) man page for the fvwm options.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
Most users just should put:
.nf
.sp
	fvwm-themes-start
.sp
.fi
as the last line of their .Xclients, .xinitrc or .xsession file.
If you want to use FVWM Themes with a real session manager, say
GNOME, you need to use the --no-start option and put:
.nf
.sp
	fvwm-themes-start --no-start
	gnome-session
.sp
.fi
as the last lines of your .Xclients, .xinitrc or .xsession file.
The session option allows to use FVWM Themes with different configurations.
Say, you want to use 3 different configurations under a normal FVWM session
when FOO test is false, under gnome-session and under a normal FVWM session
when FOO test is true. Then, your .xinitrc/.xsession file may look
as follows (where $1 is the "first" argument given by startx, or by kdm or 
gdm ...):
.nf
.sp
	...
	case $1 in
	  fvwm)
	    if FOO; Then 
	      fvwm-themes-start --session special 
	    else
	      fvwm-themes-start 
       fi
	  ;;
	  gnome)
	    fvwm-themes-start --session gnome --no-start
	    gnome-session
	  ;; 
	  ... other cases ...
	esac		
.sp
.fi
Note that with most session managers (e.g., GNOME or XSM) it is
preferable to give "fvwm -f themes-rc" as the starting window manager
command in the session manager.
