.SH "EXAMPLES"
Most user just have to put:
.nf
.sp
	fvwm-themes-start
.sp
.fi
as the last line of his/her .Xclients, .xinitrc or .xsession file.
If you want to use FVWM Themes with a real session manager, say
GNOME, you need to use the --no-start option and put:
.nf
.sp
	fvwm-themes-start --no-start
	gnome-session
.sp
.fi
as the last line of your .Xclients, .xinitrc or .xsession file.
The session option allows to use FVWM Themes with different configuration.
Say, you want to use different configuration under a normal FVWM session, 
a gnome-session and under a normal FVWM session but the
shell test FOO is true. Then, your .xinitrc/.xsession file can look 
as follows (where $1 is the "first" argument given by startx, or by kdm or 
gdm ...):
.nf
.sp
	...
	case $1 in
	  fvwm)
	    if FOO; Then 
	      fvwm-themes-start --session special 
	    else
	      fvwm-themes-start 
            fi
	  ;;
	  gnome)
	    fvwm-themes-start --session gnome --no-start
	    gnome-session
	  ;; 
	  ... other cases ...
	esac		
.sp
.fi
Note that with most session managers (e.g., GNOME or XSM) it is
preferable to give "fvwm2 -f themes-rc" as starting window manager
command for the session manager.
