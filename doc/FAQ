------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Why this FAQ does not contain my question about fvwm-themes?

A. Because there were no many questions up until now. It is a new project.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is theme, component, choice, option in the fvwm-themes terminology?

A. Component is a part of fvwm configurations, more or less separate unit,
which can be loaded and unloaded accordingly to its dependances.
Theme is nothing more than a set of its components. A theme in fvwm-themes
may be partial or full. Themes usually can be categorized as "look" theme,
"feel" theme, "content" theme or any combination of these.

One of the features of fvwm-themes is the ability to mix together components
from different themes if their dependances enable this without conflicts.
The theme author is responsible to define exact dependances for theme's
component. Dependances are not used for now, but this will be changed soon.

The definition of theme components is given in theme.cfg file of the theme.
If no such file is found, the default/theme.cfg is used for this theme.

All currently used components (probably from different themes) compose
the current theme, which is reflected in the Theme Management menu.

Any component can come with several choices, options or sub components
which allows a fine configuration. These can be used via the the Theme
Management menu under "current" or using the "Opt/Cho/Sub" button of
the Theme Center.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Why theme switching takes some time and it even increases!

A. This is because of two things. Currently entire configuration is reloaded
on every single component switch (this will be fixed in the next versions).
The second thing is the way fvwm currently stores its styles. Additional
loading will increase memory usage, so the more you switch themes, the more
memory is used and thus the slower is the switching mechanism.

We are trying our best to unload everything, which can be unloaded in all
themes to save user's memory. This will be improved.

Please execute Restart command if you expirience some memory/speed problems,
when you switch themes.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. The themes are nice, but how can I define my personal contents?

A. You can either edit existing theme components (not recommended)
or create your own theme 'personal' and put there the components
that you like to overwrite or override. Create ~/.fvwm/themes/personal dir.

Example: you want completely different menus. Copy themes/current/menus
(don't preserve symlinks) to themes/personal/menus and edit this component.
If you only want to add (not overwrite) menus, create a file named
themes/personal/menus-extra and use "AddToMenu MenuFvwmPersonal" to add
menu entries under the "Personal" entries of the "Root Menu". You may need 
to choose 'Refresh the current theme' item from the theme menu for your 
new components to be reflected in the menu, then choose your component menus 
or menus-extra from within the personal theme submenu. Use Ctrl-Alt-Mouse2 
in case you didn't include MenuFvwmThemes menu in your root menu 
(MenuFvwmRoot).

Another useful example redefining customizable functions FuncFvwmMaximize,
FuncFvwmViewManPage and others in personal/functions[-extra] component.

In the future you will need to create some configuration file in your
personal theme, describing your components. But by that time there will
be more documentation and probably some tools to help you to create your
personal theme.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How can I redefine the applications started by clicking on a button?

A. The applications started by clicking on a button is defined in the
file themes/default/functions-appbind. You should edit this file or better
copy this file in your personal theme directory and edit it. For example,
if your preferred editor is myeditor, then replace emacs by myeditor in: 

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmEditor
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmEditor
+ I Exec exec emacs

Then, a click with mouse button 1 on a button with the editor icon will
start myeditor. The functions  FuncFvwm2Editor and FuncFvwm3Editor are
used for mouse buttons 2 and 3 respectively. The others functions work
similarly.
Note that these functions are also used in the stroke bindings.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What are the default bindings?

A. As you can guess they are in themes/current/bindings and
themes/current/buttons. The default bindings were chosen to be
consistent and functional. Here is a list of some useful bindings:

  Alt-Tab               - Window List of all normal applications
  Shift-Alt-Tab         - Window List of all skipped applications

  Ctrl-Mouse2 on root   - Transient pager
  Shift-Ctrl-Mouse2     - Transient desker

  Shift-Alt-F1          - like Mouse1 on root (Root menu)
  Shift-Alt-F2          - like Mouse2 on root (Window List menu)
  Shift-Alt-F3          - like Mouse3 on root (Window Ops menu)

  Mouse1 on decorations - Resize
  Mouse2 on decorations - Move
  Mouse3 on decorations - Window Ops short menu

  Alt-Mouse1 in window  - like Mouse1 on root (Root menu)
  Alt-Mouse2 in window  - like Mouse2 on decorations (Move)
  Alt-Mouse3 in window  - like Mouse3 on root (Window Ops menu)

You can get the bindings description for every title button by holding
Ctrl-Alt and pressing that button. This should work in all themes.

For guys, which has no mouse button 2, it is sometimes simulated by Ctrl
with the mouse button 1.

See the previous question of how you can redefine your own bindings component.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is the "Stroke" option and what are the default stroke bindings?

A. Stroke allows to bind mouse motion to an action. For example, with
the default bindings if you draw a N with your mouse with button 3 pressed,
then the function FuncFvwmWWW of themes/default/function-appbind will be 
executed (which start netscape by default). You need libstroke installed 
and fvwm compiled with stroke support. libstroke can be obtained via 
anonymous ftp at http://www.etla.net/~willey/projects/libstroke/. You
need also to enable fvwm-themes stroke option.

The default bindings are defined in the file options/stroke/enabled.
Mouse button 3 is used (this button must be pressed during the stroke),
no modifier are needed when you start your mouse motion on the root
window and you must use the Alt modifier if you start your mouse motion
on a window (you cannot start your motion on a window title bar or frame).
Now the mouses motion:

 - A | from the top to the bottom start FuncFvwmTerminal
 - A / from the top to the bottom start FuncFvwm2Terminal
 - A \ from the top to the bottom start FuncFvwm3Terminal
 - A | from the bottom to the top start FuncFvwmEditor
 - A / from the bottom to the top start FuncFvwmFileManager
 - A \ from the bottom to the top start FuncFvwmDocView
 - A N from the bottom left start FuncFvwmWWW
 - A - from the right to the left start FuncFvwm2WWW
 - A - from the left to the right start FuncFvwm3WWW
 - A C from the top start FuncFvwmCalculator
 - A C from the bottom start FuncFvwmProcess
 - A L from the top left start FuncFvwmHelp
 - A L from the bottom right start FuncFvwm2Help
 - A _| from the bottom left start FuncFvwmImageView
 - A |_| from the top left start FuncFvwm2ImageView
 - A _| from the top right start FuncFvwmImageEdit
 - A |_| from the top right start FuncFvwm2ImageEdit
 - A |-| (an arch) form the bottom left start FuncFvwmMail
 - A back and forth - starting from the left start FuncFvwmCdPlayer
 - A back and forth - starting from the right start FuncFvwmSound
 - A clockwise box from the top left start FvwmForm FormFvwmQuitVerify.

The mouse motion is draw and if the the mouse motion succeed (i.e., your
motion is binded to an action) then the busy cursor is displayed during
a fraction of second. See the Stroke and StrokeFunc entries of the fvwm2
man page for more informations.

Q. Can I draw a penguin (using mouse strokes) to compile a kernel?
A. Maybe. If you are a perfect painter. :) If not, stick to simple figures
- line, 2 lines, triangle, square. Currently it is not easy to redefine
stroke motions, although we are working on making everything configurable.
But bound applications or fvwm commands are easy configurable.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Can I use fvwm-themes under a session manager?

A. Yes! First, you should start Fvwm-Themes in a special way. Put,
the following lines at the end of your "start X" file:

	fvwm-themes-start --session a_name --no-start
	exec the_sm_executable

the --session option is optional, but this allows you to use a different
Fvwm-Themes configuration when you use a given session manager or
when you use Fvwm-Themes under a normal FVWM session.

At the present time there is a special support for GNOME and a generic 
support (current->settings->Session Manager).If you want a special support 
for a given session manager ask the fvwm-themes developers.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Can I use fvwm-themes with GNOME?

A. Yes. You must have fvwm2 compiled with GNOME enabled (this the default) 
and it is preferable to run fvwm under gnome-session. Start a gnome-session 
as explained in the above question (with say --session gnome) and use the 
control center to add fvwm-themes in your list of GNOME window manager 
(Name: Fvwm-Themes, Command: fvwm2 -f themes-rc, fvwm is a session managed 
window manager). Then, you should select GNOME as Session Manager under 
(current->settings of the theme management menu). This give to you the 
GNOME "buttons" menus: Shift-Mouse 1/2/3 and a special quit menu. 
The --session gnome option ensure you that this option will be set only 
under a GNOME session. Moreover, this way, you can have a completely different
configuration under a GNOME session (e.g., starting different modules to take 
in account the GNOME panel, disabling the background if you want to use a 
GNOME background ...etc.). Others Fvwm Themes components are specially designed
for GNOME (current->settings->GNOME under the theme management menu).

If you want to use only the GNOME panel start Fvwm Themes as usual (may
be using the fvwm-themes-start --session options and start the panel before
fvwm-themes-start). If you want a stays put  panel (i.e., a panel which 
can cover and be covered by normal windows) enabled the panel stays put 
option of Fvwm Themes and disabled any GNOME configuration options 
concerning such things (you may completely restart X so that this options 
work fine).

Also, do not forget that you can run GNOME applications without using the 
GNOME panel neither a gnome-session. Again, Fvwm Themes has special
components for this: you can get the system, user and "redhat" GNOME menu
as well as Icon and MiniIcon Styles for GNOME applications. So that this
work with GNOME icons you need to use the --enable-gnome-icons option
to configure when you install fvwm-themes or you have to login under the
same user that run "make install" and run "fvwm-themes-images --ft-install".
See the fvwm-themes-images man pages for more details.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I am screwed. How can I get fvwm config in one file?

A. We will release a documentation describing the format of every component.
It is not very easy to sit and immideately create complete or partial theme,
which is clean and works well with the rest of the framework. You should
comply to some standard format and check that everything, which is allocated
is destroyed. It is actually easy if you are familar well with fvwm syntax,
but it can take some time to acquire an experience with the framework.

You can always get the fvwm configuration in one file (a-la .fvwm2rc) of
the currently used configuration (so called "current" theme) by executing:

$ fvwm-themes-config --expand-rc >current-fvwmrc

You can skip the contents at the start responsible to manipulation of themes.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How can I submit my own theme?

A. First, you should create a very clear theme. Test all possible
combinations of your components with components from other themes.
Try to make your theme as general as possible, try not to require
to run very special applications or use rare fonts.
But don't panic, you can also send us an unfinished theme; if we find it
interesting, we will finish and clean it up.

Finally, send your files to fvwm-themes-devel@lists.sourceforge.org
or contact one of the main fvwm-themes developers.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I use the X Configuration Scripts (under the Fvwm Configuration menu
   entries), but the changes I mad are not saved for the next sessions!

A. Just add the line
	.xinitrc-fvwm
in your .xinitrc or .xsession file before running fvwm-themes-start.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Where I can found some documentations on fvwm-themes-config, 
   fvwm-themes-start, fvwm-themes-menuapp, fvwm-themes-images and 
   fvwm-themes-com?

A. All this scripts (perl/shell) have a manual page.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good luck!
