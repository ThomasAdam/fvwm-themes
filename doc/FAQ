------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Why this FAQ does not contain my question about fvwm-themes?

A. Because there were no many questions up until now. It is a new project.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is theme, component, variant, option in the fvwm-themes terminology?

A. Component is a part of fvwm configurations, more or less separate unit,
which can be loaded and unloaded accordingly to its dependences.
Theme is nothing more than a set of its components. A theme in fvwm-themes
may be partial or full. Themes usually can be categorized as "look" theme,
"feel" theme, "content" theme or any combination of these.

One of the features of fvwm-themes is the ability to mix together components
from different themes if their dependences enable this without conflicts.
The theme author is responsible to define exact dependences for each theme's
component or defaults will be used if present. Dependences are not fully
checked for now, but this may be changed in the future.

The definition of theme components is given in theme.cfg file of the theme.
If no such file is found, the default/theme.cfg is used for this theme
in an intelligent manner, i.e. a list of actual components is automatically
built as a subset of all possible defined components (existing files/dirs).

All currently used components (probably from different themes) compose
the current theme, which is reflected in the Theme Management menu.

Any component can come with several variants, with options or sub components
all of which allow a good configurability. These can be used via the the
Theme Management menu under "current" or using the "Property" button of
the Themes Center.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Does fvwm-themes overwrites my .fvwm2rc? If no, how does it work?

A. No, it does not overwrites your .fvwm2rc. The only files and directories,
which fvwm-themes manages are ~/.fvwm/themes* ones, more precisely:

  ~/.fvwm/themes/ - the user themes as opposed to the site themes
  ~/.fvwm/themes/current-main/ - the current theme in the main session
  ~/.fvwm/themes/current - symbolic link to the actual current theme
  ~/.fvwm/themes-rc - the .fvwm2rc equivalent
  ~/.fvwm/themes-rc-2 - additional rc used by themes-rc, symbolic link

The rc files themes-rc and themes-rc-2 are created by fvwm-themes-config.
FVWM Themes should be loaded by fvwm-themes-start shell script, which
initializes all needed files/directories if needed and starts fvwm as:

  fvwm2 -f themes-rc

To return to your .fvwm2rc configuration, replace a call to fvwm-themes-start
with a call to fvwm2 executable in .xinitrc or other initialization file.

See other question if you want to extend menus, bindings, styles etc. used
in fvwm-themes. You should create and edit files in ~/.fvwm/themes/personal/.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Why theme switching takes some time and it even increases!

A. This is because of two things. Currently the entire configuration is
reloaded on every single component switch (this will be fixed in the next
versions). The second thing is the way fvwm currently stores its styles.
Additional loading will increase memory usage, so the more you switch themes,
the more memory is used and thus the slower is the switching mechanism.

We are trying our best to unload everything, which can be unloaded in all
themes to save user's memory. This will be improved.

Please execute Restart command if you experience some memory/speed problems,
when you switch themes. See also the answer to the next question.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. On my system switching themes crashes FVWM! What to do?

A. There is a known problem on some systems, FVWM may (or may not) randomly
crash on them when switching themes. You should try a workaround for this
problem, which does work on at least one such system.

If you define $FT_USE_RESTART environment variable, i.e. if you replace
a call to fvwm-themes-start with 'env FT_USE_RESTART=1 fvwm-themes-start',
FVWM will be restarted on every theme change. This may solve memory problems.

If this does not solve your problem, please report it to fvwm-themes
developers - fvwm-themes-devel@lists.sourceforge.org.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How much configurable is fvwm-themes?

A. We, authors of fvwm-themes try to make it as configurable as fvwm
itself while keeping inter-theme integrity. We understand that in the Free
Unix world there will never be only one solution and a choice is a solution.
fvwm-themes is very extensible, you may create new components freely.

If you want to totally reconfigure fvwm-themes, it is  possible, but to
keep an integrity with other themes, you should conform to some rules,
which are easy for small configuration changes and need some knowledge
of creating new or changing existing components for more complex changes.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. The themes are nice, but how can I define my personal contents?

A. You can either edit existing theme components (not recommended)
or create your own theme 'personal' and put there the components
that you like to overwrite or extend. Create ~/.fvwm/themes/personal dir.

Example: you want completely different menus. Copy themes/current/menus
from your ~/.fvwm to themes/personal/menus and edit this component.
Generally it is recommended to leave the component 'menus' as is and
only edit 'menus-user' if you need to customize your applications.

If you only want to extend (not overwrite) menus, create a file named
themes/personal/menus-extra and use "AddToMenu SomeMenu". For example, in
this file you can define entries of menu "MenuFvwmPersonal", which are not
normally defined anywhere, they will be shown under the "Personal" submenu
of the "Root Menu". After creating a new personal component, you need to
choose 'Refresh the current theme' item from the theme management menu for
your new created components to be reflected in the menu, then choose your
component 'menus', 'menus-user' or 'menus-extra' from within the personal
theme submenu. Use Ctrl-Alt-Mouse2 in case you didn't include MenuFvwmThemes
menu in your root menu (MenuFvwmRoot).

Another useful example is redefining customizable functions like
FuncFvwmMaximize, FuncFvwmViewManPage and others in 'functions-appbind'
component of your personal theme. To redefine only a few functions (not
all), 'functions-extra' component can be used.

All these components 'menus', 'menus-user', 'menus-extra', 'functions',
'functions-appbind', 'functions-extra' are standard, so you don't need to
define dependences for them. In case you create non standard components
you should also specify their dependences in theme.cfg of that theme.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How can I redefine the applications started by clicking on a button?

A. The applications started by clicking on a button are defined in the file
themes/default/functions-appbind. You should copy this file into your
personal theme directory and edit it (see also the previous question). Say,
if your preferred editor is myeditor, then replace emacs with myeditor in:

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmEditor
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmEditor
+ I Exec exec emacs

Then, a click with mouse button 1 on a button with the editor icon will
start myeditor. The functions FuncFvwm2Editor and FuncFvwm3Editor are used
for mouse buttons 2 and 3 respectively. Other functions work similarly.

Note that these functions are also used in the stroke bindings and more.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What are the default bindings?

A. As you can guess they are in themes/default/bindings and
themes/SOMETHEME/buttons. The default bindings were chosen to be
consistent and functional. Here is a list of some useful global bindings:

  Alt-Tab               - Window List of all normal applications
  Shift-Alt-Tab         - Window List of all skipped applications

  Ctrl-Mouse2 on root   - Transient pager
  Shift-Ctrl-Mouse2     - Transient desker

  Alt-F1                - like Mouse1 on root (Root menu)
  Alt-F2                - like Mouse2 on root (Window List menu)
  Alt-F3                - like Mouse3 on root (Window Ops menu)

  Alt-F4 .. F10         - mostly like in mwm; there is an option to add Shift

  Mouse1 on decorations - Resize, Raise, WindowShadow
  Mouse2 on decorations - Move, RaiseLower
  Mouse3 on decorations - Window Ops short menu

  Alt-Mouse1 in window  - like Mouse1 on root (Root menu)
  Alt-Mouse2 in window  - like Mouse2 on decorations (Move, RaiseLower)
  Alt-Mouse3 in window  - like Mouse3 on root (Window Ops menu)

Key bindings using numbers (on the left keyboard side and on the key pad):

  Ctrl-Alt-1 .. 4       - Go to desk 0 to 3
  Shift-Ctrl-1 .. 4     - Move the active window to desk 0 to 3
  Ctrl-Alt-KP1 .. KP9   - Go to page (like in 3x3 pager, 7 - the first page)
  Shift-Ctrl-KP1 .. KP9 - Move the active window to page (like in 3x3 pager)
  Ctrl-KP_1 .. KP_9     - Switch to window in this direction (8 - up)

Key bindings using arrows:

  Ctrl-Alt-Left ..      - Go to the page on the left (right, up, down)
  Shift-Ctrl-Alt-Left ..- Scroll by the 10% of the page to the left ..
  Shift-Ctrl-Left ..    - reserved
  Shift-Alt-Left ..     - Move the pointer by 1% of a page to the left ..

You can get the description for every title button binding by holding
Ctrl-Alt and pressing that button. This should work in all core themes.

For guys, which have no mouse button 2, it is sometimes simulated by Ctrl
with the mouse button 1.

It is possible to switch bindings of mouse buttons 2 and 3 in most of cases
by choosing the corresponding option in the default bindings component menu,
but this is a bit less consistent (for example, Alt-F2 will be like Mouse 3
on the root, not Mouse 2) and a bit less functional (can't move a window
with Mouse 3 and use PlacedByButton3 fvwm's style or use stroke inside it).

See the previous questions if you want to redefine the bindings component.
As usual, you can create 'bindings-extra' to only add/change some bindings.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is the "Stroke" option and what are the default stroke bindings?

A. Stroke allows to bind mouse motion to an action. For example, with the
default bindings if you draw a N with your mouse with button 3 pressed, then
the function FuncFvwmWWW of themes/default/function-appbind will be executed
(which starts netscape by default). You need libstroke installed and fvwm
compiled with stroke support. libstroke can be obtained via anonymous ftp at
http://www.etla.net/~willey/projects/libstroke/. You need also to enable
fvwm-themes stroke option.

The stroke bindings are defined in themes/default/settings/stroke/enabled.
Mouse button 3 is used (this button must be pressed during the stroke),
no modifier are needed when you start your mouse motion on the root
window and you must use the Alt modifier if you start your mouse motion
in a window (you cannot start your motion in a window title bar or frame).
Now the mouses motion:

  - A | from the top to the bottom executes FuncFvwmTerminal
  - A / from the top to the bottom executes FuncFvwm2Terminal
  - A \ from the top to the bottom executes FuncFvwm3Terminal
  - A | from the bottom to the top executes FuncFvwmEditor
  - A / from the bottom to the top executes FuncFvwmFileManager
  - A \ from the bottom to the top executes FuncFvwmDocView
  - A N from the bottom left       executes FuncFvwmWWW
  - A - from the right to the left executes FuncFvwm2WWW
  - A - from the left to the right executes FuncFvwm3WWW
  - A C from the top               executes FuncFvwmCalculator
  - A C from the bottom            executes FuncFvwmProcess
  - A L from the top left          executes FuncFvwmHelp
  - A L from the bottom right      executes FuncFvwm2Help
  - A _| from the bottom left      executes FuncFvwmImageView
  - A |_| from the top left        executes FuncFvwm2ImageView
  - A _| from the top right        executes FuncFvwmImageEdit
  - A |_| from the top right       executes FuncFvwm2ImageEdit
  - A |~| from the bottom left     executes FuncFvwmMail
  - forth and back from the left   executes FuncFvwmCdPlayer
  - forth and back from the right  executes FuncFvwmSound
  - A clockwise box from the top left executes FvwmFuncQuitVerify

The mouse motion is drawn for your convention and if the the mouse motion is
succeed (i.e., this motion is bound to some action) then the busy cursor is
displayed during a fraction of second. See the Stroke and StrokeFunc entries
of the fvwm2 man page for more information.

Q. Can I draw a penguin (using mouse strokes) to compile a kernel?
A. Maybe. If you are a perfect painter. :) If not, stick to simple figures
- line, 2 lines, triangle, square. Currently it is not easy to add new
stroke motions, although we are working on making everything configurable.
But redefining existing motion bindings is easy.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Can I use fvwm-themes on my multi-headed display system?

A. Yes, there are several solutions depending on what you want to get.

1) If you want the same theme to be on all your displays, you can simply
run fvwm-themes-start as usual. In this case, when you change theme
components on one screen the changes are not synchronized on all other
screens until you Restart. You can also freely use fvwm-themes sessions.
This is a simple and easy solution, you just need to remember that what you
see is not always what you will get after Restart or on the next start-up.

2) If you want to have completely separated setups on all screens, you can
run fvwm-themes like this:

	env FVWM_USERDIR=$HOME/.fvwm:0.0 fvwm-themes-start -- -s -d :0.0 &
	env FVWM_USERDIR=$HOME/.fvwm:0.1 fvwm-themes-start -- -s -d :0.1

The feature (or misfeature) of this second solution is that user themes
and sessions, if there are any, can't be shared on different screens.
This can be solved by symlinking some themes and sessions, like:

	ln -s ../../.fvwm/themes/personal $HOME/.fvwm:0.0/themes/personal
	ln -s ../../.fvwm/themes/personal $HOME/.fvwm:0.1/themes/personal
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Can I use fvwm-themes under a session manager?

A. Yes! First, you should start Fvwm-Themes in a special way. Put,
the following lines at the end of your "start X" file:

	fvwm-themes-start --session a_name --no-start
	exec the_sm_executable

the --session option is optional, but this allows you to use a different
Fvwm-Themes configuration when you use a given session manager and
when you use Fvwm-Themes under a normal FVWM session.

Then start a window manager inside a session manager by fvwm-themes-start or
(more correct) by 'fvwm2 -f themes-rc'.

At the present time there is a special support for GNOME and a generic
support (current->settings->Session Manager). If you want a special support
for a given session manager ask the fvwm-themes developers.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Can I use fvwm-themes with GNOME?

A. Yes. You should have fvwm2 compiled with GNOME enabled (this a default)
and it is preferable to run fvwm under gnome-session. Start a gnome-session
as explained in the question above (with, say, --session gnome) and use the
control center to add fvwm-themes in your list of GNOME window manager
(Name: Fvwm-Themes, Command: fvwm2 -f themes-rc, fvwm is a session managed
window manager). Then, you should select GNOME as Session Manager under
(current->settings of the theme management menu). This gives to you the
GNOME "button" menus: Shift-Mouse 1/2/3 and a special quit menu.
The "--session gnome" optional parameter ensures that this GNOME option will
be used only under a fvwm-themes's gnome session. Moreover, this way, you
can have a completely different configuration under a GNOME session (like
starting different modules to take in account the GNOME panel, using GNOME
background and thus disabling the theme backgrounds). In addition there are
GNOME-specific fvwm settings (for menus, the panel) that you can use.

If you want a stays put  panel (i.e., a panel which can cover and be covered
by normal windows) enable the panel stays put fvwm-themes option and
disable any GNOME configuration options concerning such things (you may
completely restart X for this panel setting to work fine).

Also, do not forget that you can run GNOME applications with using neither
the GNOME panel nor gnome-session. Again, Fvwm Themes has special components
for this: you can get the system, user and "redhat" GNOME menu as well as
Icon and MiniIcon Styles for GNOME applications. For GNOME icons to work
with fvwm, you need to use the --enable-gnome-icons option to configure when
you install fvwm-themes or you have to login later under the same user that
ran "make install" and run "fvwm-themes-images --ft-install".
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I am screwed. How can I get fvwm config in one file?

A. We will release a documentation describing the format of every component.
It is not very easy to sit and immediately create complete or partial theme,
which is clean and works well with the rest of the framework. You should
comply to some standard format and check that everything, which is allocated,
is destroyed. It is actually easy if you are familar well with the fvwm,
but it can take some time to acquire an experience with the framework.

You can always get the fvwm configuration in one file (a-la .fvwm2rc) of
the currently used configuration (so called "current" theme) by executing:

	% fvwm-themes-config --expand-rc >current-fvwmrc

You can skip the contents at the start responsible to manipulation of themes.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How can I submit my own theme?

A. First, you should create a very clear theme. Test all possible
combinations of your components with components from other themes.
Try to make your theme as general as possible, try not to require
to run very special applications or use rare fonts.
But don't panic, you can also send us an unfinished theme; if we find it
interesting, we will finish and clean it up.

Finally, send your files to fvwm-themes-devel@lists.sourceforge.org
or contact one of the main fvwm-themes developers.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Why changes done using X Configuration Scripts are not persistent?

A. If you want the changes done using X Configuration Scripts (under the
Fvwm Configuration submenu) to have effect your next fvwm sessions, just add
the line

	$HOME/.xinitrc-fvwm

in your .xinitrc or .xsession file before running fvwm-themes-start.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Where can I find documentations on fvwm-themes and its shell scripts?

A. All fvwm-themes perl/shell scripts (fvwm-themes-config,
fvwm-themes-start, fvwm-themes-menuapp, fvwm-themes-images, fvwm-themes-com)
have manual pages. They are, together with fvwm manual pages are accessible
from the Help menu.

See also other files in the doc/ directory, especially doc/creating-themes.
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good luck!
